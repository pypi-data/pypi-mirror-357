## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-24

### Added

* **Streamable HTTP transport** ‚Äì full first-class support for MCP's new default transport (deprecated SSE):

  * gateway accepts Streamable HTTP client connections (stateful & stateless). SSE support retained.
  * UI & API allow registering Streamable HTTP MCP servers with health checks, auth & time-outs
  * UI now shows a *transport* column for each gateway/tool;
* **Authentication & stateful sessions** for Streamable HTTP clients/servers (Basic/Bearer headers, session persistence).
* **Gateway hardening** ‚Äì connection-level time-outs and smarter health-check retries to avoid UI hangs
* **Fast Go MCP server example** ‚Äì high-performance reference server for benchmarking/demos.
* **Exportable connection strings** ‚Äì one-click download & `/servers/{id}/connect` API that generates ready-made configs for LangChain, Claude Desktop, etc. (closed #154).
* **Infrastructure as Code** ‚Äì initial Terraform & Ansible scripts for cloud installs.
* **Developer tooling & UX**

  * `tox`, GH Actions *pytest + coverage* workflow
  * pre-commit linters (ruff, flake8, yamllint) & security scans
  * dark-mode theme and compact version-info panel in Admin UI
  * developer onboarding checklist in docs.
* **Deployment assets** ‚Äì Helm charts now accept external secrets/Redis; Fly.io guide; Docker-compose local-image switch; Helm deployment walkthrough.

### Changed

* **Minimum supported Python is now 3.11**; CI upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04 / Python 3.12.
* Added detailed **context-merging algorithm** notes to docs.
* Refreshed Helm charts, Makefile targets, JWT helper CLI and SBOM generation; tightened typing & linting.
* 333 unit-tests now pass; major refactors in federation, tool, resource & gateway services improve reliability.

### Fixed

* SBOM generation failure in `make docs` (#132) and Makefile `images` target (#131).
* GitHub Remote MCP server addition flow (#152).
* REST path-parameter & payload substitution issues (#100).
* Numerous flaky tests, missing dependencies and mypy/flake8 violations across the code-base .

### Security

* Dependency bumps and security-policy updates; CVE scans added to pre-commit & CI (commit ed972a8).
