> Here's an example use of fmov for automated chess analysis videos (trimmed to 1:30 to allow for embedding)

## Installing

Install fmov via pip:

```bash
pip install fmov
```

### Dependencies

Make sure to have ffmpeg installed on your system and executable from the terminal

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg     # Linux
brew install ffmpeg         # MacOS
choco install ffmpeg        # Windows
```

[Downloading FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

> [!NOTE]
> PIL will also be installed with fmov through pip as a dependency. (unless its already installed)
