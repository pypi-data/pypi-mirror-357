    and :math:`N` is the number of classical snapshots.
    The :math:`|| O_i - \frac{\text{tr}(O_i)}{2^n} ||_{\text{shadow}}^2` is maximum shadow norm,
    which is defined in the supplementary material with value between 0 and 1.
    """

    The maximum shadow norm is used to calculate the prediction of accuracy :math:`\epsilon`

    We can calculate the prediction of accuracy :math:`\epsilon` from the equation (S13)
    in the supplementary material, the equation (S13) is as follows,

    and :math:`N` is the number of classical snapshots.
    The :math:`|| O_i - \frac{\text{tr}(O_i)}{2^n} ||_{\text{shadow}}^2` is maximum shadow norm.

    where :math:`O` is the any operator, and :math:`n` is the number of qubits,

    So we set the shadow norm as follows,
    .. math::
        \chi = || O_i - \frac{\text{tr}(O_i)}{2^n} ||_{\text{shadow}} \\
        \chi_{\infty} = 4^n || O_i - \frac{\text{tr}(O_i)}{2^n} ||_{\infty}^2 \\
        \chi^2 \leq \chi_{\infty}

    .. math::

            \leq \frac{34}{\epsilon^2} \max_{1 \leq i \leq M} \chi_{\infty}^2

    .. math::
        \epsilon \leq \sqrt{\frac{34}{N}} \max_{1 \leq i \leq M} \chi_\infty

    which mentioned in the paper at Theorem 1 (informal version).

    This is the worst scenario of the shadow norm
    for its scaling can be reduced to :math:`3^n || O ||_{\infty}^2`,
    which is the significantly lower bound than the worst case scenario.
