    When there are mulitple classical registers,

    For example, there are three registers with the size of 4, 4, and 6, 
    which the first six bits are for the randomized measurement.

        # The last four bits are the first classical register.
        # The middle four bits are the second classical register.
        # The first six bits are the last classical register for the randomized measurement.

    Due to maximum shadow norm is complex and it is a norm,
    we suppose we have the worst case scenario,
    where the maximum shadow norm is 1 as default.
    Thus, we can simplify the equation to:
