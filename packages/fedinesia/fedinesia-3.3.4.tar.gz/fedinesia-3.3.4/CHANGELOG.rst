  This commandline option takes an integer as argument. If this option is not specified no limit is enforced.

- Optional commandline option `--batch-size` or `-b` to specify how many deletes should be sent to instance as one batch.
  This commandline option takes an integer as argument.

  A sensible starting value is 10 for most instances.

- Improved debug logging by including debug log for minimal_activitypub.

.. _changelog-2.1.0:

2.1.0 — 2023-01-02

  Audit log can be enabled by specifing the file name for the audit log by using the
  `--audit-log-file` command line option.

- The style of the audit log file can be set with the `-audit-log-style` command line option.
  The Style defaults to `PLAIN` and currently the following two styles for the audit log file
  have been implemented:

  - `PLAIN` will create a plain text audit log file
  - `CSV` will create an audit log file in CSV format with all values quoted.
    A header record (also quoted) will be added if the audit log file is empty or doesn't yet exist.
