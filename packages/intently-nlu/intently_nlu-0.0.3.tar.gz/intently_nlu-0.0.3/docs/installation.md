## Install Intently NLU

It is recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) and activate it before installing Intently NLU in order to manage your project dependencies properly.

Intently NLU can be installed via pip with the following command:

`python -m pip install intently-nlu`

or

`python3 -m pip install intently-nlu`

or

`py -m pip install intently-nlu`

We currently do not provide any pre-built binaries (wheels) for intently-nlu and its dependencies. You will need to build intently-nlu and its dependencies from sources which means maybe you will need to install additional build tools before running the `pip install` command.

## Language resources

Intently NLU relies on [language resources](https://github.com/encrystudio/intently-nlu/tree/main/resources/languages) which must be downloaded separately. To fetch the resources for a specific language, run the following command:

`python -m intently_nlu download <language>`

For more information, run `python -m intently_nlu download -h`.

The list of supported languages is described [here](languages.md).
