# Supported languages

Snips NLU supports various languages. The language is specified in the [dataset](dataset.md#json-format) in the `"language"` attribute.

Some functionality of the engine needs language specific information like punctuation. You need to download language specific resources before using the language, as described here. // TODO

We use ISO639-1 language codes. We currently support:

| Language   | ISO639-1 |
| ---------- | -------- |
| German     | de       |
| English    | en       |
| Spanish    | es       |
| French     | fr       |
| Italian    | it       |
| Japanese   | ja       |
| Korean     | ko       |
| Portuguese | pt       |

Support for additional languages will come in the future, stay tuned :)
