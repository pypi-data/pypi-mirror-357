# Configuration and Extensions

The Intently NLU engine can be configured to change the behavior, add intent classifiers or add entity parsers. However, currently, the configuration and extension pipeline is considered as not stable enough for production. Therefore, we don't recommend changing the default configuration of the engine. Once the pipeline is mature enough, we will add information about how to configure it in this documentation.
