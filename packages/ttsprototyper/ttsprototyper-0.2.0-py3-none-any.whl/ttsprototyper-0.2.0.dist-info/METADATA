# Technical Trading Strategy Prototyper (`ttsprototyper`)

## Purpose

TA-based trading is a visual endeavour and should be practiced as such.
The `TTSPrototyper` class provides the means to chart each round-trip trade from a backtest, allowing you to refine your strategy directly based on charts and thus remain in the visual workflow that defines technical analysis.
