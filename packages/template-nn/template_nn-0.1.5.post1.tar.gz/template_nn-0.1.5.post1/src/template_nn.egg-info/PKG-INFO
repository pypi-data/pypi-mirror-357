# Template NN

Template NN is a lightweight, easy-to-use template built to streamline neural network prototyping. At its core, it
leverages the power of [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).

Huge thanks to the PyTorch team for enabling projects like this.


## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking Changes in 0.1.4**

```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, including usage instructions and examples, visit the online documentation
at [Documentation](https://gabrielchoong.github.io/template-nn).

### Feature Preview

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from template_nn import FNN

# Single hidden layer model
model = FNN({
    "input_size": 10,
    "output_size": 5,
    "hidden_sizes": 5,
    "activation_functions": [nn.ReLU()]
})

# Deep network with 5 hidden layers
deep = FNN({
    "input_size": 10,
    "output_size": 5,
    "hidden_sizes": [8] * 5,
    "activation_functions": [nn.ReLU()] * 5
})
```
