# System Tools TODO

## Overview
System-level operations and information gathering tools for AI agents.

## Planned Modules

### High Priority
- [ ] **Process Management** (`process.py`)
  - Command execution with timeout
  - Process spawning and monitoring
  - Subprocess communication
  - Process tree operations
  - Safe command execution
  - Return code handling

- [ ] **Environment Management** (`environment.py`)
  - Environment variable access
  - PATH manipulation
  - Working directory management
  - User/system information
  - Platform detection
  - Shell detection

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Resource Monitoring** (`resources.py`)
  - CPU usage monitoring
  - Memory usage information
  - Disk space checking
  - System load information
  - Process resource usage
  - Basic performance metrics

- [ ] **System Information** (`info.py`)
  - Operating system details
  - Hardware information (basic)
  - Network interface enumeration
  - Timezone and locale information
  - System uptime and boot time
  - Available system tools detection

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Service Management** (`services.py`)
  - System service status checking
  - Basic service interaction
  - Daemon/service utilities
  - Process management helpers

- [ ] **Logging Integration** (`logging.py`)
  - System log access (where available)
  - Log file monitoring
  - Structured logging helpers
  - Log rotation utilities

## Design Considerations
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Secure command execution (avoid shell injection)
- Proper error handling for system operations
- Resource cleanup (processes, file handles)
- Permission and security awareness
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Non-blocking operations where possible
