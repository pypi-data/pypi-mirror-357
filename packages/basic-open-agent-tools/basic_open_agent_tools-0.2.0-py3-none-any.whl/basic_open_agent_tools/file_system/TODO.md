# File System Tools TODO

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic file operations (read, write, append) - implemented in `operations.py`
- ✅ Directory operations (create, list, delete) - implemented in `operations.py`
- ✅ File metadata and information - implemented in `info.py`
- ✅ Directory tree functionality - implemented in `tree.py`
- ✅ Path validation utilities - implemented in `validation.py`

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Moved functionality to modular structure (`operations.py`, `info.py`, `tree.py`, `validation.py`)
- ✅ Created proper `__init__.py` with organized exports
- ✅ Added enhanced functionality (directory tree with depth control)

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] **File Watching/Monitoring** (`watch.py`)
  - Monitor file/directory changes
  - Event-based file system notifications
  - Polling-based monitoring for compatibility

- [ ] **File Permissions** (`permissions.py`)
  - Cross-platform permission management
  - Permission checking and validation
  - Safe permission modification

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Advanced Operations** (`operations.py` extensions)
  - Atomic file operations
  - Temporary file management
  - File locking mechanisms
  - Bulk operations (batch copy, move, delete)

- [ ] **Path Utilities** (`paths.py`)
  - Path normalization and validation
  - Relative/absolute path conversion
  - Path pattern matching
  - Cross-platform path handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] **File Comparison** (`compare.py`)
  - File content comparison
  - Directory structure comparison
  - Checksums and integrity verification

- [ ] **Archive Operations** (`archives.py`)
  - ZIP file creation/extraction
  - TAR file operations
  - Directory compression

## Design Considerations
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Use pathlib for modern path handling
- Consistent error handling with custom exceptions
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings and examples
- Security considerations for file operations
