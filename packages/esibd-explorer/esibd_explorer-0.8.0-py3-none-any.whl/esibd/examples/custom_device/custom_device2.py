    No two plugins are allowed to have the same name.
    Still you may want to replace an internal plugin with a custom version and keep using previously generated files.
    CustomDevice2 demonstrates how to do this by explicitly defining the file types used by the original plugin.
    When used, the original plugin should first be disabled in the Plugin Manager to make sure that they do not try to access the same files at the same time.

    NOTE: In a real use case, you would save this file in your custom plugin folder and not touch any files in the installation folder.
