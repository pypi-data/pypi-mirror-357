Developer Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Simplified plugins by introducing default implementations of DeviceController.values, DeviceController.applyValue, DeviceController.updateValues,
  DeviceController.initComplete, DeviceController.toggleOn, Channel.applyValue, Device.closeCommunication, and Device.setOn.
  Custom plugins need to be adjusted by deleting or simplifying functions to use default implementation!
- Fixed sequence for extending DeviceController.closeCommunication. Adjust custom plugins based on documentation and examples!
- Changed implementation of initScan. Extend addInputChannels instead.
- Abandoned use of :meta private: where it was overwriting the docstring of a parent method.
- Added documentation for many methods.

- Removed unused getInitializedChannels method.
- Restructured project structure to separate scans and displays. Using lower case convention for project folders and module files. Enabling simplified import statements,
  e.g.: from esibd.scans import Omni, from esibd.devices import ISEG, from esibd.displays import PDB.
- Introduced restore option for parameters and settings and used it to not restore values for lagging, errorCount, and interval measured.
- Removed option to edit indicators through the context menu.
- Enabled context menu for LedIndicators.
- Added type hints and improved consistency of formatting.
- Replaced EsibdConst and EsibdCore with esibd.const and esibd.core

- Renamed Parameter.TYPE to PARAMETERTYPE and widgetType to parameterType.
- Renamed outputs to outputChannels and inputs to inputChannels for scans and staticDisplays.
- Renamed scan.run to scan.runScan

Version 0.7.0 2025-01-19
========================

This version brings multiple improvements to the user interface and messages. The main new features include the Universal Channel Manager (UCM |UCM|), PID Plugin |PID|, and a channel interface for scans. The data and config file formats remain unchanged. The plugin file format is significantly simplified but requires adjustments (see below) to use old plugins with the current version!

Added
~~~~~

- Universal Channel Manager (UCM |UCM|) plugin: This plugin allows to reference arbitrary channels from other devices to create a central list of the most important information. All referenced channels can be controlled from here. The corresponding display allows to see recorded data from multiple devices in one central location. For most users this should result in improved performance and less complexity as the individual device tabs and corresponding displays will rarely be needed once the channels in the UCM are configured.
- PID Plugin |PID|: Allows to establish a PID control loop between two arbitrary channels.
- Added option to collapse |collapse| channels of same color to focus on the most relevant channels.
- Channels now allow to change Line Style and Group for plotting.
- Channels now allow to change Scaling to highlight important channels (and to see them from the other side of the lab!).
- Added channel interface for scans.
- Depo scan can now record data from arbitrary additional channels.
- Added option to inspect the object currently in the Console input.
- Option to use icons instead of labels in tab bars (active by default).
- Live Displays allow to sort plot curves by device, unit, or group (new channel parameter), and arrange them horizontally, vertically, or stacked.
- Added plugins for KEITHLEY 6487, GAA MIPS, NI9263, Pfeiffer Omnicontrol, RSPD3303C, and pico PT-104.
- Added option to generate plot files for displays including MS, Line, PDB, Holo.
- Plugin Manager now shows the supported version of plugins and highlights if they are compatible with the current program or not.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Plugin format: Much of the functionally has been moved to the base class allowing developers to use standard functionality by using a flag (useMonitors, useDisplays, useBackgrounds, useOnOffLogic) instead of implementing it in the specific plugin file. Some functions have been renamed to be more descriptive and consistent. Most important examples are: stop -> closeCommunication, init -> initializeCommunication, apply -> applyValues. Make sure to compare to build in examples and test your plugins when updating your custom plugins for the current version. Documentation in CustomDevice has been improved to demonstrate and explain the current plugin format.
- Logging is now enabled by default. More informative status, warning, and error messages. A lot more messages in debug mode.
- Using icons for messages, warnings, and errors in status bar, log file, and Console
- Old logs are regularly removed from the log file
- Reorganized internal device plugins in dedicated folders
- Temporary parameters like monitors or other device states are now saved but not restored.
- Parameters that are undefined before communication to the corresponding device is established are set to NaN to emphasize that there is no up to date value available.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Splitting Pressure plugin into dedicated TIC and MAXIGAUGE plugins. If necessary channels can be combined using UCM. Pressure plugin is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Communication has to be stopped before channels can be moved (increase stability)
- Default ini files are scanned for changes when closing and only overwritten if necessary
- Using last 10 s instead of last 10 data points to define background signal

Version 0.6.14 2023-11-07
=========================

First release public on PyPi

Version 0.6
===========

This is the first public version. All changes relative to this version will be documented in future releases.
Note, the file formats have not been altered or altered in a backwards compatible way that automatically adds default values for parameters that do not exist in old files.

Added
~~~~~

- standalone installer available for windows

Changed
~~~~~~~

- internal plugins are kept in the program folder and may be affected by updates.
  Users can specify a plugin path and add custom plugins, but are responsible to maintain them.
- Complete overhaul of user interface and docking system.

Version 0.5
===========

Update notes: For a save update, backup and remove all files from your config folder.
These files will be automatically generated in the correct format.
You may then adjust them as necessary based on your backed up files, while sticking to the new format.
All device and display code is now organized as plugins.

Version 0.4
===========

Update notes: You need to delete settings.ini and config.h5 from your settings folder.
Updated versions will be generated on the first start after the update. You can then manually restore your settings.
In the future, file format changes during updates will be automated.
In this release, the definition of lens and name in the current tab were changed to name and deviceName to increase consistency.
Please adjust your settings accordingly after the first start.

Added
~~~~~

- Added "Depo" tab to display and document deposition.
- Added "Move to Recycle Bin" feature to explorer items.
- The device configuration can be exported directly to the current session.
- The most common current plot functions are now directly attached to the current plot and always accessible. In addition, the voltage button moved here to indicate the voltage status at all times and allow quick access in case of an emergency.
- The position on the 2D scan is indicated by a cursor.
- The manual can be accessed from the Help menu.
- The optimization progress is shown in a dedicated tab while running.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Result of mass analysis is shown in plot.
- The initial signal is used instead of 0 to initialize 2D scans, making to displayed color range more useful.
- Background subtraction is active by default, though there is no effect until backgrounds are defined.

- Fixed live update of min max limits for voltage channels.
- Scans cannot be started before the previous scan has been saved.
