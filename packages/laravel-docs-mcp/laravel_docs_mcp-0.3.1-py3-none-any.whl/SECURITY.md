## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by creating a **private security advisory** on GitHub:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/brianirish/laravel-docs-mcp/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability" 
3. Provide details about the vulnerability

This will create a private discussion that only you and I can see until we decide how to handle it.

For non-security bugs, please use the regular [issue tracker](https://github.com/brianirish/laravel-docs-mcp/issues).
