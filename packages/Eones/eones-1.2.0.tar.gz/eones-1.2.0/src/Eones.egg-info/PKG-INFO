## ✨ What is Eones?

Eones is a minimalist, dependency-free library for expressive, clear, and powerful date/time manipulation. Inspired by natural language semantics, it allows you to manipulate, compare, and transform dates as if they were living entities.

> *“That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die.”*  
> — *Abdul Alhazred*, Necronomicon

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install "eones"
```

> If you're working with timezones on Windows or containers:  
> ⚠️ Also install `tzdata`:
> ```bash
> pip install tzdata
> ```

---

## 🧪 Basic Example

```python
from eones import Eones

z = Eones("2025-06-15")
z.add(months=1, days=3)  # -> add 3 days and 1 month

print(z.format("%Y-%m-%d"))  # → 2025-07-18
print(z.diff_for_humans("2025-06-10"))  # → in 5 days
print(z.diff_for_humans("2025-06-20", locale="es"))  # → hace 5 días
```

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Automatic parsing for `str`, `dict`, `datetime`, `Eones`
- ✅ Add/subtract days, months, years, minutes, seconds
- ✅ Date comparison (same week, within year, between ranges)
- ✅ Full day/month/year ranges
- ✅ Truncation and rounding by unit
- ✅ Full support for `ZoneInfo` (PEP 615)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies
- ✅ Conversion to `datetime`, `date`, and native types
- ✅ Human-friendly differences via `diff_for_humans` with locale support

You can add more languages by creating a new file in `eones/locales/` with the
translations for your locale. For example, `fr.py` for French.
