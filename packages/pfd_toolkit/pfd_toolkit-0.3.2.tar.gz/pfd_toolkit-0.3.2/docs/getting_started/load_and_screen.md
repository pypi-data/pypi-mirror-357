# Getting started

This page talks you through an example workflow using PFD Toolkit: loading a dataset and screening for relevant cases related to "detention under the Mental Health Act". 

This is just an example. PFD reports contain a breadth of information across a whole range of topics and domains. But in this workflow, we hope to give you a sense of how the toolkit can be used, and how it might support your own project.

## Installation

PFD Toolkit can be installed from pip as `pfd_toolkit`:

```bash
pip install pfd_toolkit
```

Or, to update an existing installation:

```bash
pip install -U pfd_toolkit

```

!!! Note
    PFD Toolkit is not currently available via Anaconda. If you'd like this to change, please make a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Sam-Osian/PFD-toolkit/issues). Personally, we love using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/) as an alternative to (Ana)conda for dependency management.

## Load your first dataset

First, you'll need to load a PFD dataset. These datasets are updated weekly, meaning you always have access to the latest reports with minimal setup.

```py
from pfd_toolkit import load_reports

# Load all PFD reports from January 2024 to May 2025
reports = load_reports(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2025-05-01")

reports.head(n=5)
```

## Screen for relevant reports

You're likely using PFD Toolkit because you want to answer a specific question. For example: "Do any PFD reports raise concerns related to detention under the Mental Health Act?"

*[detention]: Often referred to as 'being sectioned'

PFD Toolkit lets you query reports in plain English â€” no need to know precise keywords or categories. Just describe the cases you care about, and the toolkit will return matching reports.

### Set up an LLM client

Before screening reports, we first need to set up an LLM client. Screening and other toolkit features require an LLM to work.

You'll need to head to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and create an API key. Once you've got this, simply feed it to the `LLM`.


```python
from pfd_toolkit import LLM

# Set up LLM client
llm_client = LLM(api_key=YOUR-API-KEY) # Replace with actual API key
```

!!! note
    For a more detailed guide on using LLMs in this toolkit, see [Setting up an LLM client](../llm_setup.md).


### Screen reports in plain English

Now, all we need to do is specify our `user_query` (the statement the LLM will use to filter reports), and set up our `Screener`.


```python
from pfd_toolkit import Screener

# Create a user query to screen/filter reports by
user_query = "Concerns about detention under the Mental Health Act **only**"

# Set up & run our Screener
screener = Screener(llm = llm_client, # LLM client you set up above
                        reports = reports) # Reports that you loaded earlier

filtered_reports = screener.screen_reports(
    user_query=user_query)

# Count number of identified reports
len(filtered_reports)
```

```sh
>> 51
```

`filtered_reports` returns a filtered version of our original PFD dataset, containing the 51 reports that the LLM believed matches our query.


!!! note
    For more information on Screening reports, see [Screening relevant reports](../screener/index.md).


Now that we've loaded and screened our reports for relevance to being _detained under the Mental Health Act_, our next step is to discover recurring themes. In other words, concerns that coroners keep raising.
