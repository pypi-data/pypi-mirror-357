Pythagix

Pythagix is a lightweight Python utility library for working with number theory.
It offers essential math functions like checking primes, computing triangle numbers, finding GCDs, and more — all in a fast, dependency-free package.

Installation

```bash
pip install pythagix
```
Features

is_prime(number) — Check if a number is prime

prime_list(numbers: list) — Return all prime numbers from a list

nth_prime(n) — Get the n-th prime number

gcd(numbers: list) — Compute the greatest common divisor of a list

is_perfect_square(n) — Check if a number is a perfect square

count_factors(n) — Count the total number of factors of a number

triangle_number(n) — Compute the n-th triangle number

Example Usage

```python
from pythagix import is_prime, nth_prime, gcd, triangle_number

print(is_prime(13))        # True
print(nth_prime(10))       # 29
print(gcd([12, 18, 24]))   # 6
print(triangle_number(7))  # 28
```
