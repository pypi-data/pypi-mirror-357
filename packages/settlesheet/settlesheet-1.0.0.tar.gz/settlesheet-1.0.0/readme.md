## What the Sheet is This?

SettleSheet is a **spreadsheet-based expense tracker**, with many templates that are ready to go.  The python script generates usable and functional Excel files for tracking and splitting group expenses. No apps to download, no accounts to create, no servers to maintain, and no "premium features" locked behind a paywall. Just pure, unadulterated spreadsheet magic.

**Why SettleSheet?** Because arguing about who owes what is more exhausting than actually paying for stuff.

### **Don't Know How to Code? No Problem!**

You have two ways to use SettleSheet:

1. **Download a Template** (Zero coding required) - Grab one of the pre-made [templates](./templates/), change the names, and start tracking expenses immediately
2. **Generate Custom Spreadsheets** (Optional Python) - Run the Python script to create customized spreadsheets with your preferred themes, currencies, and participant lists

**Pro Tip:** Create your spreadsheet, upload it to Google Sheets, and give everyone in your group access. Now anyone can add expenses in real-time from their phone during your trip. No more "I'll tell you what I spent later" excuses!

### Key Features

- **üì± Works Everywhere**: Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice - if it can open a spreadsheet, it can handle your financial drama
- **ü§ù Real-Time Collaboration**: Upload to Google Sheets, share with your group, let everyone add expenses from their phone as they happen
- **üé¨ Zero Installation Required**: Download a template and start using immediately - no coding, no apps, no hassle
- **üåç Multi-Currency Support**: Because your European vacation involved at least 5 different currencies and you're still confused
- **üßÆ Optimized Settlements**: Uses clever programming to minimize the number of transactions (because nobody wants to Venmo 47 different people)
- **üé® Pretty Colors**: 6 visually appealing themes so your expense tracker can be as aesthetic as your Instagram
- **üí° Smart Formulas**: Automatically calculates who owes what, supports subgroups such as writing "John, Sarah" instead of "All" in the expense participants field
- **üîÑ Real-Time Updates**: Change an expense amount and watch the settlement calculations update instantly

## Quick Start (Get Your Sheet Together)

### Installation

**For immediate use:** 
Download a template from [`/templates`](./templates/) folder - no other installation required!

**For custom spreadsheet generation:**

```bash
pip install settlesheet
```

**Or clone from source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/settlesheet.git
cd settlesheet  
## Modify the script with desired sheet generation calls.
## Then, run to generate sheets:
python SettleSheet.py
```

## Usage

### **Option 1: Download & Go (Recommended for Most People)**

**The fastest way to get started:**

1. **Download a template** from the [`/templates`](./templates/) folder (or generate one using the examples below)
2. **Upload to Google Sheets** (or open in Excel/LibreOffice)
3. **Share with your group** - give everyone edit access
4. **Start adding expenses** as they happen during your trip
5. **Watch the magic** as settlements calculate automatically

**Why Google Sheets?** Everyone has a Google account, everyone has a phone, and everyone can add expenses in real-time. No more post-trip archaeology trying to remember what that ‚Ç¨23.50 charge was for.

### **The Group Collaboration Workflow**

This is where SettleSheet really shines:

1. **Before your trip:** Create/download your expense sheet
2. **Upload to Google Sheets** and share with all participants  
3. **During your trip:** Anyone can add expenses immediately. Real-time updates, real-time settlement amounts.
4. **End of trip:** The spreadsheet automatically updates totals, everyone knows exactly who owes what. No extra steps or headaches required.

### **Option 2: Create Custom Spreadsheets (For the Python-Inclined)**

Want custom themes, specific currencies, or particular participant lists? Generate your own:

#### Installation

**Method A: Install via pip (Recommended)**
```bash
pip install settlesheet
```

**Method B: Clone from GitHub**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/settlesheet.git
cd settlesheet
python SettleSheet.py
```

*Dependencies: openpyxl (automatically installed with pip)*


#### Basic Domestic Expenses
```python
from settlesheet import create_expense_spreadsheet

# Create a basic domestic trip spreadsheet
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="weekend_trip.xlsx",
    participants=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    exchange_rates=None  # No foreign currency conversion needed
)
```

#### International Trip with Single Currency
```python
# Single foreign currency (like a trip to Japan)
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="tokyo_adventure.xlsx",
    participants=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Daisuke"],
    exchange_rates={"JPY": 1/149.25},  # 1 JPY = 0.0067 = 1/149.25 USD
    native_currency="USD",
    color_theme="sleek"
)
```

#### Multi-Country European Chaos
```python
# Multiple currencies for that epic Euro trip
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="european_chaos.xlsx",
    participants=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Enrique", "Francesca", "Giles", "Holly"],
    exchange_rates={
        "EUR": 1.10,    # 1 EUR = 1.10 USD
        "GBP": 1.27,    # 1 GBP = 1.27 USD  
        "CHF": 1.08     # 1 CHF = 1.08 USD
    },
    native_currency="USD",
    color_theme="bold",
    background_color="auto"
)
```

**üí± Exchange Rate Direction:** The rates represent how much 1 unit of the local currency equals in your native currency. For example:
- `"EUR": 1.10` means 1 Euro = 1.10 USD
- `"JPY": 0.0067` means 1 Yen = 0.0067 USD

**üîÑ Rate Conversion Tip:** If you use rates quoted the other way (like "123.45 JPY = 1 USD"), just use `1/rate`:
```python
exchange_rates={"JPY": 1/149.25}  # Converts 149.25 JPY per USD to 0.0067 USD per JPY
```

### Using Your Spreadsheet

Once you've generated your spreadsheet (or downloaded one of the template files), here's how to actually use it:

#### 1. **Initial Setup**
- **Change participant names**: Edit the colored participant cells to match your group members
- **Update exchange rates** (multi-currency only): Check current rates and update the currency table
- **Choose your theme**: The spreadsheet comes pre-styled, but you can modify colors if needed

#### 2. **Adding Expenses**

Navigate to the expense table and start adding your expenses. Each row represents one expense:

| Date | Description | Amount | Paid By | Participants |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-03-15 | Dinner downtown | 84.50 | Alice | All |
| 2024-03-15 | Uber to hotel | 23.00 | Bob | Alice, Bob |
| 2024-03-16 | Museum tickets | 45.00 | Charlie | Alice, Charlie, Diana |
| 2024-03-16 | Alice's metro card | 12.00 | Alice | Alice |

**Key Points:**
- **Participants**: Use "All" for everyone, or list specific people: "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
- **Paid By**: Only one person per payment row (see limitations below) - if more than one person paid, just enter what each paid & who it applies to on separate rows
- **Amount**: Just the number - currency formatting is handled automatically. For multi-currency spreadsheets, also update the currency paid in.
- Single participant expenses are allowed, such as the metro card example above.  This can be useful for keeping track of your total trip expenses, even those not split among the group. 

#### 3. **Adding More Expense Rows**

When you need more rows:
1. **Copy formulas down**: Select the last expense row and copy it down to create new rows
2. **The formulas will automatically adjust** to the new row numbers
3. **Or simply type in new rows** - the totals will update automatically

#### 4. **Reading Your Results**

The spreadsheet provides two settlement methods:

##### **Direct Settlements Matrix**
- Shows exactly what each person owes each other person
- More transactions, but very clear about individual debts
- Look for the "Settlements (Who Pays Whom)" section

##### **Optimized Settlements Matrix**  
- Uses the 'greedy' algorithm to minimize the total number of transactions among the entire group
- Fewer payments needed overall, which means they likely look different from the direct debts
- Look for the "Optimized Settlements (Minimized Transactions)" section

**Optimized settlement Example 1**: Instead of Alice paying Bob $20, Bob paying Charlie $15, and Charlie paying Alice $5, the optimized version might just show Alice paying Charlie $10.

**Optimized settlement Example 2**:  
Suppose four people (Alice, Bob, Charlie, David) share several expenses:

- Alice pays $60 for dinner (split among Alice, Bob, Charlie)
- Bob pays $30 for drinks (split among Bob, Charlie, David)
- Charlie pays $20 for dessert (split among all four)

Without optimization, there would be 7 separate payments between group members to settle up.
With direct pairwise netting, this reduces to 5 transactions, as debts are offset where possible.
With optimized settlements (greedy method), only 3 payments are needed:
- David pays $15 to Alice
- Charlie pays $15 to Alice
- Bob pays $5 to Alice

This achieves the same net result for everyone, but with the minimum number of transactions.

### Important Limitations & Workarounds

- **Even splits only**: All expenses are split evenly among the specified participants. For uneven splits, create separate line items.
  ```
  Instead of: "Dinner $100, Alice pays 50%, Bob pays 30%, Charlie pays 20%"
  Do this:    "Dinner - Alice's portion: $50, Alice, Alice"
              "Dinner - Bob's portion: $30, Alice, Bob" 
              "Dinner - Charlie's portion: $20, Alice, Charlie"
  ```

- **Single payer per row**: "Paid By" only accepts one person. If multiple people split a payment, create separate rows.
  ```
  Instead of: "Hotel $200, John, Sarah, All"  
  Do this:   "Hotel - John's half: $100, John, All"
             "Hotel - Sarah's half: $100, Sarah, All"
  ```

## Example Scenarios

### üè† **The Roommate Situation**
```python
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="roommate_expenses.xlsx",
    participants=["Alex", "Jordan", "Casey"],
    exchange_rates=None,  # No foreign currency
    color_theme="neutral"
)
```
*Perfect for tracking groceries, utilities, and that time someone bought way too much toilet paper.*

### ‚úàÔ∏è **The Group Vacation**
```python
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="bali_trip.xlsx",
    participants=["Sarah", "Mike", "Emma", "David", "Lisa"],
    exchange_rates={"IDR": 0.000067},  # 1 IDR = 0.000067 USD (or use 1/15000)
    native_currency="USD", 
    color_theme="bright"
)
```
*For when you're in Bali and everything costs either 50 cents or $50 and nobody can math anymore.*

### üåç **The Euro Trip that Broke the Bank**
```python
create_expense_spreadsheet(
    filename="euro_trip_2024.xlsx",
    participants=["Team Chaos", "Budget Destroyer", "Card Decliner"],
    exchange_rates={
        "EUR": 1.10,     # 1 EUR = 1.10 USD
        "GBP": 1.27,     # 1 GBP = 1.27 USD
        "CHF": 1.08,     # 1 CHF = 1.08 USD
        "SEK": 0.096     # 1 SEK = 0.096 USD
    },
    native_currency="USD",
    color_theme="sleek"
)
```
*When you've been to 4 countries in 5 days and your wallet is crying in multiple languages.*

## Features That'll Make You Think "Holy Sheet!"

### **Six Appealing Themes**
- **[Bright](./images/bright.png)**: For optimists and people who like colors. I'm told they exist.
- **[Neutral](./images/neutral.png)**: For adults who have their life together. I'm told they also exist, but I'm less sure.
- **[Sleek](./images/sleek.png)**: For minimalists and people with that timeless taste.
- **[Bold](./images/bold.png)**: For those who want their spreadsheet to pop.
- **[Dark](./images/dark.png)**: For night owls and Batman fans.
- **[Light](./images/light.png)**: For people who actually use white mode. (shudder)

### **Two Settlement Methods**
1. **Direct Settlements**: Shows exactly what each person owes each other person
2. **Optimized Settlements**: Uses a greedy algorithm to minimize total transactions

*Example: Instead of 6 separate payments, you might only need 2. Your Venmo will thank you.*

### **Multi-Currency Magic**
- Automatically converts all expenses to your home currency
- Updates exchange rates as needed
- Handles the chaos of "Wait, was that ¬£20 or ‚Ç¨20?"

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q: Is this better than [insert popular expense app]?**  
A: It's a spreadsheet. It works offline, doesn't track your data, and won't suddenly start charging you $9.99/month for "premium features."

**Q: What if someone can't use Excel?**  
A: Google Sheets is free and works in any browser. If they can't figure that out, maybe they shouldn't be handling money.

**Q: Can I customize it?**  
A: It's a spreadsheet! You can customize it until your heart's content. Add more participants, change colors, add your own formulas - go wild.

**Q: What if the math is wrong?**  
A: The math is handled by Excel formulas that are more reliable than your friend who "definitely paid for dinner last time."  Still, if you do encounter a bug in the formulas, submit a bug report or pull request and I'll push a fix.

## Support This Project

If SettleSheet helped you avoid awkward "who owes what" conversations, saved you from spreadsheet-induced migraines, or prevented a friendship from ending over $12.43 in disputed expenses ‚Äî consider sponsoring. Your support helps fund the essential developer survival kit: coffee for late-night formula debugging, snacks for those "why won't Excel cooperate" moments, and the occasional AI assistant that's surprisingly good at the tasks I've been putting off because I didn't wanna.

No pressure though ‚Äî this tool is completely free and always will be. But if you're feeling generous after successfully settling your group's chaotic expense situation, I'll definitely send some good financial karma your way (and maybe add that feature you've been thinking about).
