## Orchestration Strategy

### Phase 1: Security Hardening (Week 1)
```bash
# Run security implementation tasks in parallel
npx claude-flow sparc run code "implement JWT authentication for MCP server"
npx claude-flow sparc run code "add Pydantic input validation models"
npx claude-flow sparc run code "implement data encryption at rest"

# Store progress in memory
npx claude-flow memory store security_phase "JWT auth, input validation, encryption implemented"
```

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Week 2)
```bash
# Modularize MCP server
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "design modular MCP server architecture"
npx claude-flow sparc run code "refactor MCP server into modular components"

# Optimize vector operations
npx claude-flow sparc run code "implement GPU-accelerated vector operations"
npx claude-flow sparc run code "add batch processing and caching to vector memory"

# Store optimization results
npx claude-flow memory store perf_phase "MCP modularized, vector ops optimized"
```

### Phase 3: Test Enhancement (Week 3)
```bash
# Implement comprehensive tests
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "test coverage for optimized components"
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "configuration system unit tests"
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "CLI and entry point tests"

# Run full test suite
npm run test
npm run test:coverage

# Store test results
npx claude-flow memory store test_phase "Test coverage increased to 80%+"
```

### Phase 4: Final Optimizations (Week 4)
```bash
# Configuration cleanup
npx claude-flow sparc run refinement-optimization-mode "streamline configuration system"

# Memory system enhancements
npx claude-flow sparc run code "parallelize memory consolidation algorithms"

# Clean up duplicate tests
npx claude-flow sparc run code "consolidate duplicate FastMCP test files"
```

```bash
# Store daily progress
npx claude-flow memory store daily_$(date +%Y%m%d) "Progress summary"

# Query blockers
npx claude-flow memory query blockers
```

### Weekly Reviews
- Performance benchmarks comparison
- Security scan results
- Test coverage reports
- Remaining task prioritization

## Resource Allocation

### Claude-Flow Modes Usage
- **architect**: System design tasks
- **code**: Implementation tasks
- **tdd**: Test development
- **security-review**: Security validation
- **refinement-optimization-mode**: Performance tuning
- **integration**: Component integration

### Parallel Execution
Multiple tasks can be executed in parallel using different Claude-Flow instances:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Security tasks
npx claude-flow sparc run code "authentication implementation"

# Terminal 2: Performance tasks
npx claude-flow sparc run code "vector optimization"

# Terminal 3: Testing tasks
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "component testing"
```

## Completion Criteria

The optimization project is considered complete when:
1. All critical security vulnerabilities are addressed
2. Performance targets are met or exceeded
3. Test coverage reaches 80%+
4. Documentation is updated
5. All high-priority tasks are completed

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 security implementations immediately
2. Set up monitoring and metrics collection
3. Create feature branches for each major change
4. Schedule daily sync meetings
5. Prepare rollback procedures

This coordination plan ensures systematic optimization of SAFLA while maintaining system stability and security throughout the process.
