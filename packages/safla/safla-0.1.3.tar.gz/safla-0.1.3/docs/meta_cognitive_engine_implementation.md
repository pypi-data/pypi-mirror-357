This document summarizes the successful implementation of the Meta-Cognitive Engine for SAFLA (Self-Aware Feedback Loop Algorithm) using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The implementation represents the final core component that provides self-awareness, goal management, strategy selection, performance monitoring, and adaptation capabilities.

## TDD Implementation Process

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
