"""
Model iteration strategy module for MLTuneX.

This module defines strategies for iterating over machine learning models
during training. It provides different iteration approaches based on the
machine learning library being used, with support for parallel processing
where available.

Examples:
    >>> strategy = IterationStrategy.get_iteration_strategy("sklearn")
    >>> models, results = strategy(train_fn, eval_fn, model_list, X, y)

class IterationStrategy:
    """
    Defines iteration strategies for different machine learning libraries.

    This class provides static methods that implement different approaches
    to iterate over and train multiple models. Each strategy is optimized
    for specific machine learning libraries.

    Methods
    -------
    iterate_sklearn_models
        Strategy for training scikit-learn models sequentially.
    get_iteration_strategy
        Factory method to get appropriate iteration strategy.

        """
        Iterate over Scikit-Learn models for training and evaluation.

        This method implements sequential training of scikit-learn models,
        collecting both trained models and their evaluation results.

        Parameters
        ----------
        train_function : Callable
            Function to train individual models.
        evaluate_function : Callable
            Function to evaluate trained models.
        models : List[Tuple[str, object]]
            List of tuples containing (model_name, model_class).
        x_train : array-like
            Training features.
        y_train : array-like
            Training target values.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[Dict, List]
            - Dict mapping model names to trained model instances
            - List of evaluation results for each model

        Notes
        -----
        Models that fail to train (return None) are skipped in the results.
