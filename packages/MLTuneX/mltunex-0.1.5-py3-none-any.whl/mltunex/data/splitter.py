"""
Data splitting implementation for MLTuneX.

This module provides concrete implementation of data splitting operations
using scikit-learn's train_test_split functionality. It implements the
BaseDataSplitter interface to maintain consistency across the framework.

    """
    Implementation of data splitting operations.

    This class provides concrete implementation for splitting data into
    training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split.
    It ensures reproducibility by using a fixed random state.

    Methods
    -------
    split_data(X, y, test_size: float) -> Tuple
        Splits input data into training and testing sets.

    def split_data(self, X, y, test_size: float = 0.2) -> Tuple:
        """
        Split the data into training and testing sets.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like
            Features matrix.
        y : array-like
            Target variable vector.
        test_size : float, optional (default=0.2)
            The proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple
            (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) containing:
            - X_train: Training features
            - X_test: Testing features
            - y_train: Training target
            - y_test: Testing target

        Notes
        -----
        Uses fixed random_state=42 for reproducibility.
