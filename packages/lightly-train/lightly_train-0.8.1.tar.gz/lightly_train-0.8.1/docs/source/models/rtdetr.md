# RT-DETR

This page describes how to use the [official RT-DETR implementation](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR)
with LightlyTrain.

```{note}
RT-DETR is not a pip-installable Python package. For this reason,
RT-DETR is not fully integrated with LightlyTrain and has to be
installed manually.
```

## RT-DETR Installation

To install RT-DETR for use with LightlyTrain, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR.git
```

We assume that all commands are executed from the `RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch` directory
unless otherwise stated:

```bash
cd RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch
```

Next, create a Python environment using your preferred tool and install the required dependencies.
Some dependencies are fixed to specific versions to ensure compatibility with RT-DETR:

```{note}
Due to recent changes in the RT-DETR repository, RT-DETR's dependencies are compatible
with Python >=3.8 and <=3.10. However, if you don't need TensorRT support, you can 
simply comment out the `tensorrt` dependency in the `requirements.txt` file and you 
should be able to use Python 3.11 or 3.12 as well.
```

```bash
pip install lightly-train -r requirements.txt
```

## Pretrain and Fine-tune an RT-DETR Model

### Pretrain

Run the following script to pretrain an RT-DETR model. The script must either
be executed from inside the `RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch` directory or the
`RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch` directory must be added to the Python path.

```python
import lightly_train
from lightly_train.model_wrappers import RTDETRModelWrapper
from src.core import YAMLConfig

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the RT-DETR model
    # Change the config file to the desired RT-DETR model
    config = YAMLConfig("configs/rtdetr/rtdetr_r50vd_6x_coco.yml")
    config.yaml_cfg["PResNet"]["pretrained"] = False
    config.yaml_cfg["PResNet"]["freeze_norm"] = False
    config.yaml_cfg["PResNet"]["freeze_at"] = -1
    model = config.model

    # Pretrain the model
    wrapped_model = RTDETRModelWrapper(model)
    lightly_train.train(
        out="out/my_experiment",
        data="my_data_dir", # Replace with your dataset path.
        model=wrapped_model,
    )
```

### Fine-Tune

After the pretraining completes, the model can be fine-tuned using the default
RT-DETR training script by providing the path to the pretrained model:

```bash
# Training on single-gpu
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python tools/train.py -c configs/rtdetr/rtdetr_r50vd_6x_coco.yml --resume out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_last.pt
```

See the [RT-DETR repository](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR/tree/main/rtdetrv2_pytorch)
for more information on how to fine-tune a model.

## Supported Models

The following RT-DETR model variants are supported:

- `rtdetr_r18vd`
- `rtdetr_r34vd`
- `rtdetr_r50vd`
- `rtdetr_r50vd_m`
- `rtdetr_r101vd`
