To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to any tree view
2.  select some records
3.  open the sidebar menu and click 'Duplicate'

Note that even when selecting all records via the top checkbox on a
list, this will only duplicate the currently visible items. If you
really need to duplicate all records, you need to adjust the list view
limit accordingly.
