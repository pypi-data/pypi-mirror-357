# Creating a PR

Want to make an update? Just open a pull request!

For larger changes, we recommend creating an issue first (if one doesn’t already exist). This helps align on what’s needed before diving into development.

# Issues

Found a bug? Something not working as expected? Have user feedback? Open an issue to get the fastest response.

If you’re looking for something to contribute, feel free to pick up an existing issue and submit a PR!

# Feature requests

Got an idea for an improvement? Open an issue and tag it as an Enhancement.

We appreciate every idea—please include as much context as possible about why it’s needed and how it would help.
