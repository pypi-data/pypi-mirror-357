# Norway Water Temperature API Client
A Python package to fetch water temperature data from various locations in Norway.

## Installation
```
pip install yrwatertemperatures
```

## API key
To use this package, you need an API key from yr.no, see https://hjelp.yr.no/hc/no/articles/5949243432850-API-for-badetemperaturer for more info. 

## Usage
First, you'll need to get an API key from the provider of the water temperature data.

Then, you can use the package like this:

```python
from yrwatertemperatures import WaterTemperatures

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
client = WaterTemperatures(api_key)

try:
    # Fetch the water temperature data
    temperatures = client.get_all_water_temperatures()

    # Print the location and temperature
    for temp in temperatures:
        print(f"Location: {temp.name}, Temperature: {temp.temperature}Â°C")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
