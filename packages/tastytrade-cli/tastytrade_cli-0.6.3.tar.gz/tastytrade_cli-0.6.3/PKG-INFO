# tastytrade-cli

An easy-to-use command line interface for Tastytrade!

![Peek2024-12-0322-18-ezgif com-speed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca9d3a0-19d4-4eac-bd4a-db78d62a991f)

## Installation

The best way to install the CLI is by using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). This will install `tt` to your path.
```
$ uv tool install tastytrade-cli
```
You can also install in a virtual environment:
```
$ pip install tastytrade-cli
```

> [!WARNING]  
> The CLI is still under active development. Please report any bugs, and contributions are always welcome!

## Usage

Available commands:
```
tt option              view chains, buy or sell equities and futures options
tt pf (portfolio)      view and close positions, check margin and analyze BP usage
tt trade               buy or sell stocks/ETFs, crypto, and futures
tt order               view, replace, and cancel orders
tt plot                plot charts directly in the terminal! requires `gnuplot` installed
tt wl (watchlist)      view prices and metrics for symbols in your watchlists (pending further development!)
```
For more options, run `tt --help` or `tt <subcommand> --help`.

## Configuration

Many aspects of the CLI's behavior can be customized using the `ttcli.cfg` file generated upon the first usage of the CLI. The file is located in your OS's home directory followed by the path `.config/ttcli/ttcli.cfg`. If you don't know where that is, you can just run `python -c "from ttcli.utils import config_path; print(config_path)"`.

The default configuration file contains lots of options along with explanations of what they do.

## Development/Contributing

This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.
Make sure you already have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed!

Creating a virtualenv for development:
```
$ uv sync
```

It's usually a good idea to make sure you're passing tests locally before submitting a PR:
```
$ make lint
```

If you have a feature suggestion, find a bug, or would like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
