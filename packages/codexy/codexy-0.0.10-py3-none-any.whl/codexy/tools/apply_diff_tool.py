**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Must start with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` (exactly 7 < symbols + space + SEARCH)
2. Next line: `:start_line:NUMBER` where NUMBER is the 1-based line number where SEARCH content starts
3. Separator: At least 2 hyphens `--` or more `-------` on their own line
4. EXACT_CONTENT_TO_FIND: Must match the file content character-for-character (including whitespace)
5. Separator: At least 2 equals `==` or more `=======` on their own line
6. NEW_CONTENT_TO_REPLACE_WITH: The replacement content
7. Must end with `>>>>>>> REPLACE` (exactly 7 > symbols + space + REPLACE)

**EXAMPLE - Single line change:**
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:5
-------

>>>>>>> REPLACE

**EXAMPLE - Multi-line change:**

-------

=======
def new_function():

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- The SEARCH content must match the file EXACTLY (same indentation, spaces, etc.)
- Line numbers are 1-based (first line = 1, not 0)
- Multiple blocks can be concatenated in one diff string
- Each block is processed independently""",
