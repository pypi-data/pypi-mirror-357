## Original TypeScript Version

This project is a Python reimplementation of the original OpenAI Codex CLI, written in TypeScript. You can find the original repository here:

[openai/codex (TypeScript)](https://github.com/openai/codex)

This Python version aims to provide similar functionality using Python tools and libraries.

## Experimental Technology Disclaimer

Codexy (the Python implementation of Codex CLI) is an experimental project under active development. It is not yet stable, may contain bugs, incomplete features, or undergo breaking changes. We're building it in the open with the community and welcome:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Pull requests
- Good vibes

Help us improve by filing issues or submitting PRs (see the Contributing section)!

## Quickstart

Install globally using pip:

```shell
pip install -U codexy
```

Next, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# Optional: Set a custom base URL for the OpenAI API (e.g., for a proxy or self-hosted service)
# export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your-custom-base-url"
# Optional: Set the API request timeout in milliseconds
# export OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS="300000" # e.g., 300000 for 5 minutes
```

> **Note:** This command sets the key only for your current terminal session. To make it permanent, add the `export` line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`).
>
> **Tip:** You can also place your API key and other environment variables into a `.env` file at the root of your project:
>
> ```env
> OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
> # Optional:
> # OPENAI_BASE_URL=your-custom-base-url
> # OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
> ```
>
> The CLI will automatically load variables from `.env` using `python-dotenv`.

Run interactively:

```shell
codexy
```

Or, run with a prompt as input (and optionally in `Full Auto` mode):

```shell
codexy "explain this codebase to me"
```

```shell
# Be cautious with auto-approval modes
codexy --approval-mode full-auto "create the fanciest todo-list app"
```

That's it – Codexy will interact with the OpenAI API, suggest file changes or commands, and (depending on your approval mode) execute them.

---

## Why Codexy?

Codexy aims to bring the power of the original Codex CLI to the Python ecosystem. It's built for developers who prefer Python tooling or want to integrate agentic coding capabilities into Python workflows.

- **Familiar Python Stack:** Uses common Python libraries like `click`, `textual`, `openai`, `httpx`.
- **Terminal-Native:** Designed for developers who live in the terminal.
- **Agentic Capabilities:** Understands prompts, interacts with code, suggests file edits, and can execute commands.
- **Configurable Approvals:** Control the level of autonomy the agent has.
- **Open Source:** Contribute to its development and see how it works.

## Security Model & Permissions

Codexy lets you decide the level of autonomy the agent has via the `--approval-mode` flag (or configuration file). The modes determine what actions require your explicit confirmation:

| Mode                      | What the agent may do without asking                    | Still requires approval                     | Notes                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Suggest** <br>(default) | • Read files<br>• Run known safe read-only commands¹   | • **All** file edits/writes<br>• Shell commands | Safest mode, requires confirmation for most actions.                     |
| **Auto Edit**             | • Read files<br>• Apply file edits/writes<br>• Safe reads¹ | • Shell commands                            | Automatically modifies files, but asks before running commands.          |
| **Full Auto**             | • Read/write files<br>• Run shell commands²<br>• Safe reads¹ | –                                           | Attempts auto-approval, **BUT sandboxing is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**.     |
| **Dangerous Auto**        | • Read/write files<br>• Run shell commands              | –                                           | **UNSAFE**. Auto-approves everything without sandboxing. Use with caution. |

¹ *Known safe read-only commands include `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `git status`, etc. User-configurable via `safe_commands` in config.*
² *While `full-auto` aims for sandboxed execution, **sandboxing is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** in this Python version. Commands will run directly.*

**⚠️ Important:** The Python version (`codexy`) currently **lacks the platform-specific sandboxing** (like macOS Seatbelt or Docker/iptables) found in the original TypeScript version. In `full-auto` mode, commands are executed directly on your system without network or filesystem restrictions imposed by the tool itself. The `dangerous-auto` mode explicitly runs everything unsandboxed. Use auto-approval modes with extreme caution, especially outside of trusted environments or version-controlled repositories.

Codexy will show a warning/confirmation if you start in `auto-edit`, `full-auto`, or `dangerous-auto` while the directory is _not_ tracked by Git, so you have a safety net via version control.

## Configuration

Codexy looks for configuration files in `~/.codexy/` (note the `codexy` directory name).

-   **`~/.codexy/config.yaml`** (or `.yml`, `.json`): Main configuration.
-   **`~/.codexy/instructions.md`**: Global custom instructions for the agent.
-   **`~/.codexy/history.json`**: Stores command history.

**Example `config.yaml`:**

```yaml
# ~/.codexy/config.yaml
model: o4-mini # Default model to use
approval_mode: suggest # suggest | auto-edit | full-auto | dangerous-auto
full_auto_error_mode: ask-user # ask-user | ignore-and-continue
notify: false # Enable desktop notifications (Not fully implemented)
history:
  max_size: 1000
  save_history: true
safe_commands: # Commands safe to auto-approve in 'suggest' mode
  - git status
  - ls -la
```

**Example `instructions.md`:**

```markdown
- Always use snake_case for Python variables.
- Add type hints to all function definitions.
- Prefer f-strings for formatting.
```

### Memory Compression

To help manage the conversation history and prevent exceeding the model's context length limit, Codexy includes a memory compression feature. When enabled, it automatically compresses older parts of the conversation history.

**How it Works:**

*   The initial system prompt (from `instructions.md` or project docs) is always kept, if present.
*   A configurable number of the most recent messages in the conversation are kept uncompressed.
*   Messages between the initial system prompt and the recent messages are replaced with a single system notification indicating that a portion of the history has been summarized (e.g., `[System: X previous message(s) were summarized due to context length constraints.]`).

**Configuration:**

These settings are configured within the `memory` object in your `~/.codexy/config.json` or `~/.codexy/config.yaml` file.

*   `enable_compression` (boolean):
    *   Set to `true` to enable the memory compression feature.
    *   Default: `false`.
*   `compression_threshold_factor` (float):
    *   A value between 0.0 and 1.0. Compression is triggered when the estimated token count of the current conversation history exceeds this factor multiplied by the model's maximum context window size.
    *   For example, if the model's max tokens is 4096 and this factor is `0.8`, compression will be attempted when the history exceeds approximately 3277 tokens.
    *   Default: `0.8`.
*   `keep_recent_messages` (integer):
    *   The number of most recent messages to always keep uncompressed at the end of the conversation.
    *   Default: `5`.

**Example `config.json`:**

```json
{
  "model": "o4-mini",
  "memory": {
    "enable_compression": true,
    "compression_threshold_factor": 0.75,
    "keep_recent_messages": 10
  }
  // ... other settings
}
```

**Example `config.yaml`:**

```yaml
model: o4-mini
memory:
  enable_compression: true
  compression_threshold_factor: 0.75
  keep_recent_messages: 10
# ... other settings
```

## Project Docs

Similar to the original Codex CLI, Codexy can load project-specific context from a `codex.md` (or `.codex.md`, `CODEX.md`) file.

It searches the current directory first, then walks up to the Git root (`.git` directory). If found, its content is appended to your global `instructions.md`.

Disable this behavior with `--no-project-doc` or by setting the environment variable `CODEXY_DISABLE_PROJECT_DOC=1`.

## Zero Data Retention (ZDR) Organization Limitation

> **Note:** Codexy (Python) currently inherits the same limitation as the original Codex CLI and does **not** support OpenAI organizations with [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data#zero-data-retention) enabled due to its reliance on API features incompatible with ZDR. You may encounter 400 errors if your organization uses ZDR.
