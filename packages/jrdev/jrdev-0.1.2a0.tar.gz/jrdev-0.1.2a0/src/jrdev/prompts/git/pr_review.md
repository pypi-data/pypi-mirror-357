Review the following diff as if it is a pull request that was submitted. Keep your tone positive and upbeat. Look for code added that could add technical debt to 
the project and call it out. Don't nitpick tiny things, nothing is ever perfect, but do make sure to nitpick obvious issues as well as not complying with 
the rest of the project's styling and conventions. Keep an eye out for vulnerabilities being introduced as well as any performance concerns. 
Be thorough but constructive. Focus on providing actionable feedback that would help improve the code, and keep in mind that 
all projects are a work in progress, so keep in mind that there are likely plans to improve many of the items. Focus on the code that was
 added, not on the code that already existed.

The review should be easy to understand and digest, start with a one paragraph summary of the review that is written in sentences. The summary must not contain numbered lists or bullet points at all.
