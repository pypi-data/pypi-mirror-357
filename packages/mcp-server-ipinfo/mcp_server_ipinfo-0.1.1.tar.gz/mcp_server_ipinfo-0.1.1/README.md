# IP Geolocation MCP Server

This is a simple [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that uses the [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) API to get detailed information about an IP address.
This can be used to determine where the user is located (approximately) and what network they are used.
