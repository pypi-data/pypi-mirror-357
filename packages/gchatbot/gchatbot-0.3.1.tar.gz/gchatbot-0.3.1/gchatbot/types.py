# --- Type Aliases for Response Types ---

ProgressiveResponse = Tuple[str, Awaitable[str]]
"""
Type alias for progressive responses, which are serverless-safe.

A progressive response is a tuple containing:
- First element (str): Quick response text sent immediately to the user.
- Second element (Awaitable[str]): An awaitable (like a coroutine) that will be
  executed in the background by FastAPI's BackgroundTasks. Its final string
  result will be used to update the original message.

Example:
    async def my_long_task():
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
        return "Task complete!"

    # In _processSlashCommand:
    return ("Starting your long task...", my_long_task())
"""

ResponseType = Union[str, ProgressiveResponse]
"""
Type alias for all possible valid return types from bot processing methods.

Bot methods (_processMessage, _processSlashCommand) can return:
- str: A simple text response, sent synchronously.
- ProgressiveResponse: A tuple for two-stage asynchronous responses.

Examples:
    # Simple response
    return "Hello, world!"
    
    # Progressive response
    return ("Starting...", my_long_task())
