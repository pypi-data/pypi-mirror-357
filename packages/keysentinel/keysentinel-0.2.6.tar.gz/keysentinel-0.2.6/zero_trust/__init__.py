The Zen of Zero Trust, by Davi Guides

If it's not encrypted, it's exposed.
If it's on disk, it's compromised.
If it's in memory, it's fleeting.
If it's persistent, it's vulnerable.
If it's not questioned, it's assumed unsafe.
Trust nothing. Verify everything.
Your machine is a battlefield, not a sanctuary.
Defense is built through discipline, not convenience.
Encryption is not optional. Awareness is not optional.
Ephemerality is safety. Paranoia is wisdom.
Build for failure. Assume breach. Guard the moment.
Because local is not secure. It never was.
