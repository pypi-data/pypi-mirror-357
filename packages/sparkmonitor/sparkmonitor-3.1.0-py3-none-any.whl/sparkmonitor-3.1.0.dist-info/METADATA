           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Requirements

- **JupyterLab 4** or **Jupyter Notebook 4.4.0** or later
- **PySpark 3.x** or **4.x**
  - SparkMonitor requires **Spark API mode "Spark Classic"** (default in Spark 3.x and 4.0).
  - **Not compatible** with [Spark Client (Spark Connect)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html), which uses the new decoupled client-server architecture.

## Features

- **Live Monitoring:** Automatically displays an interactive monitoring panel below each cell that runs Spark jobs in your Jupyter notebook.
- **Job and Stage Table:** View a real-time table of Spark jobs and stages, each with progress bars for easy tracking.
- **Timeline Visualization:** Explore a dynamic timeline showing the execution flow of jobs, stages, and tasks.
- **Resource Graphs:** Monitor active tasks and executor core usage over time with intuitive graphs.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install sparkmonitor # install the extension

# set up an ipython profile and add our kernel extension to it
ipython profile create # if it does not exist
echo "c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions.append('sparkmonitor.kernelextension')" >>  $(ipython profile locate default)/ipython_kernel_config.py

# When using jupyterlab extension is automatically enabled

# When using older versions of jupyter notebook install and enable the nbextension with:
jupyter nbextension install sparkmonitor --py
jupyter nbextension enable  sparkmonitor --py
```

### How to use SparkMonitor in your notebook

Create your Spark session with the extra configurations to activate the SparkMonitor listener.
You will need to set `spark.extraListeners` to `sparkmonitor.listener.JupyterSparkMonitorListener` and
`spark.driver.extraClassPath` to the path to the sparkmonitor python package: `path/to/package/sparkmonitor/listener_<scala_version>.jar`  
Example:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder\
        .config('spark.extraListeners', 'sparkmonitor.listener.JupyterSparkMonitorListener')\
        .config('spark.driver.extraClassPath', 'venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sparkmonitor/listener_2.13.jar')\
        .getOrCreate()
```

Legacy: with the extension installed, a `SparkConf` object called `conf` will be usable from your notebooks. You can use it as follows:

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext
# Start the spark context using the SparkConf object named `conf` the extension created in your kernel.
sc=SparkContext.getOrCreate(conf=conf)
```

## Development

If you'd like to develop the extension:

```bash

# See package.json scripts for building the frontend
yarn run build:<action>

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Symlink jupyterlab extension
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .

# Watch for frontend changes
yarn run watch

# Build the spark JAR files
sbt +package

```

## History

- The first version of SparkMonitor was written by krishnan-r as a [Google Summer of Code project](https://github.com/krishnan-r/sparkmonitor) with the [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/swan/) Notebook Service team at [CERN](http://home.cern/).

- Further fixes and improvements were made by the team at CERN and members of the community maintained at [swan-cern/jupyter-extensions/tree/master/SparkMonitor](https://github.com/swan-cern/jupyter-extensions/tree/master/SparkMonitor)

- [Jafer Haider](https://github.com/itsjafer) worked on updating the extension to be compatible with JupyterLab as part of his internship at Yelp.

  - Jafer's work at the fork [jupyterlab-sparkmonitor](https://github.com/itsjafer/jupyterlab-sparkmonitor) has since been merged into this repository to provide a single package for both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook.

- Further development and maintenance is being done by the SWAN team at CERN and the community.
