# Meta-Tools

Three *client-side* helpers improve reasoning without extra server calls.

| Tool | Parameters | Behaviour |
|------|------------|-----------|
| `__think__` | `thought: str` | Appends hidden assistant message for chain-of-thought. Not shown to the user. |
| `__summarize__` | _none_ | Replaces existing history (except system prompt) with a concise recap generated by the LLM. |
| `__clarify__` | `question: str` | Returns early to the caller with `answer = question` so your UI can ask the user. |

## Example Conversation Flow

```text
User   : "Plot sales & profit by region."
LLM    : thinks it needs raw data → calls `get_sales`, `get_profit` in parallel
AIClient: executes tools, returns data
LLM    : "Should I show a chart or raw numbers?" → calls `__clarify__`
AIClient: returns early with the question → UI asks user
User   : "Chart please."
LLM    : calls `render_chart` (display tool)
AIClient: yields `tool_display` chunk → UI renders chart
```

## Why Hidden?

Internal reasoning often contains partial or incorrect thoughts.  Keeping it out of the user interface improves UX while still giving the model scratch-pad space.
