# Token Accounting

!!! warning "Coming Soon"
    This feature is currently under development. The documentation will be available once the API is stable.

This section will detail how to use the `usage_sink` callback in the `AIClient` to track token usage and costs for LLM calls, and how to persist this data for analysis and billing.
