# Turkle

Run a clone of Amazon's Mechanical **Turk** service in your **local environment**.

Turkle is implemented as a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)-based web 
application that can be deployed on your local network or hosted on a public
server. It is compatible with Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) from Amazon 
Mechanical Turk. Turkle can use the same HTML Task template files and CSV
files as the MTurk requester web GUI. The results of the Tasks completed by
the workers can be exported to CSV files.

Turkle's features include:
- Authentication support for Users
- Projects can be restricted to Users who are members of a particular Group
- Projects can be configured so that each Task needs to be completed by multiple Workers (redundant annotations)
- An admin GUI for managing Users, Groups, Projects, and Batches of Tasks
- A RESTful API for managing Users, Groups, Projects, and Batches.
- Docker images using the SQLite or MySQL database backends

Full documentation is available at [Read the Docs](https://turkle.readthedocs.io/).
