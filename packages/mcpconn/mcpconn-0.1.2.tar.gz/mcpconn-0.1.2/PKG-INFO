# mcpconn: The Missing Connector for AI

**mcpconn** is a Python library that provides a simple and efficient way to connect your applications to AI models using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It acts as a wrapper around the `mcp` library, offering a streamlined client interface for seamless integration with various AI providers and transport protocols.

## ✨ Features

- **Simplified Client Interface**: A high-level `MCPClient` for easy interaction with MCP servers.
- **Multi-provider Support**: Out-of-the-box support for Anthropic and OpenAI models. **Note:** OpenAI only supports remote MCP endpoints (not local/stdio/localhost). See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp
- **Flexible Transports**: Connect to servers using STDIO, SSE, or Streamable HTTP. **OpenAI only supports remote MCP endpoints.**
- **Built-in Guardrails**: Protect your application with content filtering, PII masking, and injection detection.
- **Conversation Management**: Easily manage conversation history, context, and persistence.
- **Asynchronous by Design**: Built with `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new LLM providers, transports, or guardrails.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install mcpconn
```

### Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use `mcpconn` to connect to an MCP server and interact with an AI model:

```python
import asyncio
from mcpconn import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Connect to a local server using STDIO (Anthropic only)
    client = MCPClient(llm_provider="anthropic")
    await client.connect("python examples/simple_server/weather_stdio.py")

    # ---
    # OpenAI usage example (remote MCP only):
    # client = MCPClient(llm_provider="openai")
    # await client.connect("https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp", transport="streamable_http")
    # ---

    # Note: OpenAI does NOT support local/stdio/localhost servers. See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp

    # Start a conversation
    conversation_id = client.start_conversation()
    print(f"Started conversation: {conversation_id}")

    # Send a message and get a response
    response = await client.query("Hello, world!")
    print(f"AI: {response}")

    # Disconnect from the server
    await client.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
