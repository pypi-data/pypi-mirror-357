# The CODEOWNERS file is used by GitHub to automate assigning code reviews, see
# [1] and [2].
#
# Remember, *the last rule to match wins*, and you need a trailing slash to get
# recursive ownership of a directory.
#
# When you send a PR to update this file, please look at the "Files" tab and
# fix any errors Github reports.
