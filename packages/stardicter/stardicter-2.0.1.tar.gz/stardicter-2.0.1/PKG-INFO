Requirements
============

Scripts require dictzip to compress dictionaries. You can get it from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/

Installation
============

You can either clone the git repositry and run the scripts from it or install
using pip::

    pip install stardicter

Usage
=====

The main script is ``sdgen.py``, it downloads and generates StarDict
dictionaries. Check it's help for more information.

Additionally there are some helper script which directly generate tarballs with
dictionary.

Generating dictionary from dicts.info
=====================================

The https://dicts.info/ server provides downloadable dictionaries for many
languages. Unfortunately the license does not allow redistribution, so you need
to generate them yourself. With stardicter it is easy:

    ./dicts_info_tarball.sh italian czech

This generates tarball with italian-czech dictionary. You can choose any
language provided by the service.
