PlutoPrint
==========

PlutoPrint is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python library for generating high-quality PDFs and images directly from HTML or XML content. It is based on `PlutoBookâ€™s <https://github.com/plutoprint/plutobook>`_ robust rendering engine and provides a simple API to convert your HTML into crisp PDF documents or vibrant image files. This makes it ideal for reports, invoices, or visual snapshots.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install plutoprint

PlutoPrint depends on `PlutoBook <https://github.com/plutoprint/plutobook>`_. For faster builds, it is highly recommended to `install PlutoBook and its dependencies manually <https://github.com/plutoprint/plutobook?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-guide>`_ beforehand. Otherwise, Meson will build them from source during installation, which can significantly increase build time.

For Windows 64-bit users, PlutoPrint provides prebuilt binaries, so no additional setup is required.

Quick Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   import plutoprint

   book = plutoprint.Book(plutoprint.PAGE_SIZE_A4)
   book.load_html("<b> Hello World </b>")
   book.write_to_pdf("hello.pdf")
