class Bot(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class representing a bot in a game.

    Attributes:
        side (TeamSide): The side to which the bot belongs.
        number (int): The player number in its team
        init_position (Point): The initial position of the bot.
        mapper (Mapper): The mapper associated with the bot.

    Methods:
        on_disputing(order_set: OrderSet, game_snapshot: GameSnapshot) -> OrderSet: Method called when the player is on DISPUTING_THE_BALL state
        on_defending(order_set: OrderSet, game_snapshot: GameSnapshot) -> OrderSet: Method called when the player is on DEFENDING state
        on_holding(order_set: OrderSet, game_snapshot: GameSnapshot) -> OrderSet: Method called when the player is on HOLDING_THE_BALL state
        on_supporting(order_set: OrderSet, game_snapshot: GameSnapshot) -> OrderSet: Method called when the player is on SUPPORTING state
        as_goalkeeper(order_set: OrderSet, game_snapshot: GameSnapshot, state: PLAYER_STATE) -> OrderSet: Method is called on every turn, and the player state is passed at the last parameter.
        getting_ready(game_snapshot: GameSnapshot): Abstract method for bot preparation before the game.

    Usage:
    Define a subclass of Bot and implement the abstract methods for specific bot behaviors.
