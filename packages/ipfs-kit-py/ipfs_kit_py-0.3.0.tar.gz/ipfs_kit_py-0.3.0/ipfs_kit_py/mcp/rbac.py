# Made synchronous and accepts a generic request object with a 'headers' attribute
def get_current_user_role(request: Any) -> str: # Changed type hint to Any
    """
    Placeholder function to determine the current user's role from request headers.
    This needs to be implemented based on the actual authentication mechanism
    (e.g., decoding a JWT token from Authorization header, checking session cookie,
    validating API key header).
    For now, it checks a custom header 'X-User-Role' or defaults to 'guest'.

    Args:
        request: An object representing the incoming request, expected to have
                 a `.headers` attribute (like Starlette's Request).
    """
    if not hasattr(request, 'headers'):
        # Fallback or raise error if headers are not accessible
        return "guest" # Default to guest if headers can't be read

    # Example: Check for a custom header 'X-User-Role'
    role = request.headers.get("X-User-Role", "guest")
    # Validate the role against known roles
    validated_role = role if role in ROLES_PERMISSIONS else "guest"
    # Storing role in request.state might not work outside FastAPI context
    # If needed, the caller function should handle storing the role.
    # request.state.user_role = validated_role

# --- FastAPI specific code removed ---
# The PermissionChecker class and require_permission factory relied on FastAPI's Depends system.
# Manual checks will be done inside the MCP tools instead.

# Example of how to test manually:
# class MockRequest:
#     def __init__(self, headers):
#         self.headers = headers
#
# req_user = MockRequest({"X-User-Role": "user"})
# req_guest = MockRequest({})
# req_admin = MockRequest({"X-User-Role": "admin"})
#
# print("Testing user role:")
# some_protected_function(req_user) # Should grant access
# print("\nTesting guest role:")
# some_protected_function(req_guest) # Should deny access
# print("\nTesting admin role:")
# some_protected_function(req_admin) # Should grant access
