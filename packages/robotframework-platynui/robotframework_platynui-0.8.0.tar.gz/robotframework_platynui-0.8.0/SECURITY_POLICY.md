# Security Policy

This document outlines the process for responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities in the **robotframework-PlatynUI** project. We value the security of our users and contributors, and we appreciate your efforts to help us maintain a secure project environment.

## Scope

This Security Policy applies to all publicly available code within the **robotframework-PlatynUI** repository. It covers vulnerabilities in:

- The source code contained in this repository.
- Any documentation or website content hosted as part of the project.
- Dependencies and related tools that are part of the project distribution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose the Vulnerability**
   Please refrain from discussing, disclosing, or committing any details of the vulnerability publicly. We request that you keep this information confidential while we work to resolve the issue.

2. **Submit Your Report**
   Send a detailed report to the project maintainers by email at:
   `testautomatisierung@imbus.de`

   Your report should include:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggested fixes or additional information that can help us diagnose and resolve the issue.

3. **Provide Necessary Context**
   Include information about your testing environment, such as:
   - Operating system, software version, and any other relevant dependencies.
   - How the vulnerability was discovered or its potential triggers.

## Vulnerability Response Process

- **Acknowledgment:**
  Upon receiving your report, the maintainers will acknowledge receipt within five business days.
- **Investigation:**
  We will promptly investigate the report and strive to provide updates regarding the status and proposed fix as soon as practicable.
- **Resolution:**
  Once the vulnerability is confirmed, a patch or appropriate remediation will be made available.
- **Disclosure:**
  After resolution, a public disclosure may be issued to provide details of the vulnerability and instructions for upgrading, if necessary. We will work with you to ensure responsible disclosure practices are maintained.

## Guidelines for Responsible Disclosure

- **Cooperation:**
  We appreciate your cooperation in providing us the necessary time to investigate and address the reported vulnerability.
- **Sensitivity:**
  If you believe that your communication has been mishandled or require further discussion about the security details, please contact us at the provided email address.
- **Legal Considerations:**
  By choosing to report in good faith, you agree to our use of this information to improve the security of the **robotframework-PlatynUI** project. We do not take any action that may compromise your confidentiality.

## Exclusions

This policy does not cover:
- Issues that are primarily aesthetic or minor bugs with no direct security impact.
- Vulnerabilities within third-party software unless integrated directly as a dependency in the project.

## Final Note

Your efforts are highly appreciated as they help to keep the project secure and protect our users. We thank you for your contribution and responsible approach in handling security matters.
