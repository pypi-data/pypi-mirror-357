# Repository Content Report Acceptance Guidelines

This document provides guidance for repository administrators on how to accept, review, and address content reports in the **robotframework-PlatynUI** repository. These guidelines are designed to ensure that all content-related concerns raised by the community are handled promptly, respectfully, and consistently.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to:

- Ensure that reported content is reviewed thoroughly and fairly.
- Provide transparency on the process for evaluating reported content.
- Outline the steps for communication and resolution related to content issues.

## 2. Scope

These guidelines apply to any reports concerning the following:

- Inappropriate or abusive content in issues, pull requests, commit messages, or any repository documentation.
- Content that violates community standards or the project's Code of Conduct.
- Any other content deemed potentially harmful or otherwise not in alignment with the repository's policies.

## 3. Receiving a Report

When a content report is received, repository administrators should:

- **Acknowledge Receipt:**
  Send an acknowledgment to the reporter within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 48 hours), confirming that the report has been received and is under review.
- **Collect Information:**
  Request any additional information from the reporter if necessary, such as screenshots, links, or detailed descriptions to ensure that all relevant details are captured.

## 4. Evaluation Process

Administrators should follow a consistent process when evaluating content reports:

- **Review the Report:**
  Examine the report details and assess the reported content against the repository's guidelines, Code of Conduct, and any other applicable policies.
- **Consult the Team:**
  If the report is ambiguous or involves complex issues, discuss the content report with fellow administrators or relevant project maintainers to decide on appropriate action.
- **Determine the Severity:**
  Classify the issue based on severity (e.g., minor inconsistency vs. serious misconduct) and evaluate the potential impact on the community.

## 5. Taking Action

Based on the evaluation outcome, administrators may choose to take one or more of the following steps:

- **Accept the Report and Take Corrective Action:**
  If the reported content is found to be in violation, take the necessary actions (e.g., editing the content, removing it, or issuing a warning).
- **Communicate the Decision:**
  Inform the reporter about the findings and any actions taken, maintaining appropriate confidentiality where necessary.
- **Document the Process:**
  Log the report details, evaluation process, and resolution (if appropriate) to maintain transparency and for future reference.

## 6. Communication and Follow-Up

- **Reporter Communication:**
  Keep the reporter informed at every stage of the process. Provide clear and concise explanations if no action is taken, ensuring that their concerns are acknowledged.
- **Public Communication (if applicable):**
  When an action involves public content (for example, editing a comment or issue), consider whether a public note or update is needed to inform the community.
- **Appeal Process:**
  Outline a method for reporters to appeal the decision if they are unsatisfied with the resolution. This can be done through a dedicated channel or by re-opening the discussion with the administrators.

## 7. Best Practices

To ensure effective handling of content reports, administrators should:

- **Act Promptly:**
  Address reports as soon as possible to maintain trust within the community.
- **Maintain Impartiality:**
  Evaluate reports based solely on the guidelines and facts. Avoid personal bias in decision-making.
- **Be Respectful and Professional:**
  Communicate respectfully with all parties involved. Uphold the communityâ€™s standards of professionalism.
- **Review and Update Guidelines Regularly:**
  Periodically review these guidelines to ensure they remain relevant and effective, and update them in response to community feedback or emerging needs.
