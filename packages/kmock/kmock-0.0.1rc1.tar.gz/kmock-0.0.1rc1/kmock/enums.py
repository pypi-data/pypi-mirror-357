    In most cases, there is no big difference between the HTTP method `DELETE`
    and the Kubernetes-level action of deletion, so the `"delete"` can be used.
    If it matters, the action criterion can be enforced either by passing
    an enum value `action.DELETE` explicitly (not a string), or as the keyword

# A trick to support unknown methods as instances of method, despite not accessible as method.XYZ.
# I.e., they will always have .name & value & a good repr & pass the isinstance(â€¦, method) check.
#   method('GET') -> method.GET
#   method('get') -> method.GET
#   method('unknown') -> has .name & .value, though it is unavailable as method.UNKNOWN
#   action('LIST') -> action.LIST
#   action('list') -> action.LIST

# Python StdLib overwrites __new__ with its own restrictive code, so we monkey-patch post-factum:

action.__new__ = lambda cls, value: cls.guess(value)
