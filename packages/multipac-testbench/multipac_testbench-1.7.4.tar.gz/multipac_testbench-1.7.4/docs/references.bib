	abstract = {Electronmultipacting can cause loss of the field level in resonators or it can break the high power rf components like couplers and windows. This phenomenon starts if certain resonant conditionsfor electron trajectories are fulfilled and if the impacted surface has a secondary yield larger than one. A general cure against multipacting is to avoid the resonant conditions. Therefore, we investigated the dynamics ofthe electron trajectories in order to find rules for these resonances. We developed new computational methods which combine the standard trajectory calculations with advanced searching and analyzing methods for multipacting resonances. In numerical experiments we consider different coaxialstructures. We are able to find those rf incident power levels at which the multipacting occurs and, thereafter, to locate and identify different multipacting processes. We characterize multipacting behavior in straight and tapered lines, and for the straight coaxial line we give simple scaling laws for the multipacting power bands with respect to the diameter, impedance and frequency. Furthermore, the present analysis method turns out to be a powerful tool for optimizing different methods to suppress multipacting. Here, in particular, the biasing DC voltage method is considered.},
