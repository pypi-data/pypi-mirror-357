# 🧠 NineBit CIQ Python SDK

![](banner.png)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ninebit-ciq)](https://pypi.org/project/ninebit-ciq)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/NineBit-Computing/ciq-py-client)](https://github.com/NineBit-Computing/ciq-py-client/blob/main/LICENSE)

Official Python client for interacting with [NineBit CIQ](https://ciq.ninebit.in), a workflow orchestration platform for rapid prototyping of AI/ML ideas using enterprise data and open-source models.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Auth via API Key (`X-API-Key` header)
- ⚙️ Trigger & track workflows (synchronously or asynchronously)
- 🔄 Get live workflow status
- 🧵 Non-blocking execution via threads
- 🧰 CLI support for easy experimentation
- 📦 Lightweight, synchronous, and logging-enabled

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install ciq-py-client
```

Or clone and install locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/NineBit-Computing/ciq-py-client.git
cd ciq-py-client
pip install .
```

## 🧪 Quickstart (Python)

```python
from ninebit_ciq import NineBitCIQClient

client = NineBitCIQClient(
    base_url="https://api.ciq.ninebit.in",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

# 1. Fetch design time workflow JSON
workflow = client.get_design_time_workflow()
print(workflow)

# 2. Trigger a new workflow
wf_id = client.trigger_workflow({"input": "your data here"})
print("Triggered Workflow ID:", wf_id)

# 3. Wait until the workflow completes
result = client.wait_for_completion(wf_id)
print("Final Result:", result)

```

## 🧠 Non-Blocking Workflow Monitoring

CIQ workflows are asynchronous — they may take time to complete. You can track them without blocking the main thread.

▶ Python (Threaded)

```python
import threading
from ninebit_ciq import NineBitCIQClient

def on_complete(result):
    print("Workflow finished:", result)

def wait_async(client, wf_id):
    result = client.wait_for_completion(wf_id)
    on_complete(result)

client = NineBitCIQClient("https://api.ciq.ninebit.in", "YOUR_API_KEY")
wf_id = client.trigger_workflow({"input": "data"})

threading.Thread(target=wait_async, args=(client, wf_id)).start()
print("Main thread is free to do other work.")
```

## 🖥️ CLI Usage

The SDK also includes a simple CLI for rapid experiments:

```
# Show design-time workflow JSON
ciq-cli --base-url https://api.ciq.ninebit.in --api-key YOUR_API_KEY get-workflow

# Trigger a workflow
ciq-cli --base-url https://api.ciq.ninebit.in --api-key YOUR_API_KEY trigger-workflow --data '{"input": "your data"}'

# Check workflow status (blocking)
ciq-cli --base-url https://api.ciq.ninebit.in --api-key YOUR_API_KEY get-status --wf-id YOUR_WF_ID

# Check workflow status (non-blocking)
ciq-cli --base-url https://api.ciq.ninebit.in --api-key YOUR_API_KEY get-status --wf-id YOUR_WF_ID --async_mode
```

## 🔐 Authentication

Pass your API Key using the X-API-Key header:

Python SDK: NineBitCIQClient(base_url, api_key)
CLI: --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

## 📚 SDK Reference

| Method                                                | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `get_design_time_workflow()`                          | Fetches the base workflow configuration     |
| `trigger_workflow(data: dict)`                        | Triggers a new workflow and returns `wf_id` |
| `get_workflow_status(wf_id)`                          | Gets the current status of a workflow       |
| `wait_for_completion(wf_id, interval=5, timeout=300)` | Polls until the workflow completes          |

## 🛠️ Logging

You can control logging verbosity:

```python
from ninebit_ciq import NineBitCIQClient
import logging

client = NineBitCIQClient(base_url, api_key, log_level=logging.INFO)
```

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, the code is generated programmatically. Additions made directly would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening an issue first to discuss with us!
