  # MVC-API Architecture

  MVC-API architecture is used for building **RESTful APIs** with clear separation of concerns:

  - The **controllers** manage the application logic and handle API requests.
  - The **models** define the data structures and interact with the database.
  - The **routes** define the API endpoints and their routing logic.
  - The **tests** contain unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the API.
  - The **utils** provide helper functions and utility classes for reusable logic.
