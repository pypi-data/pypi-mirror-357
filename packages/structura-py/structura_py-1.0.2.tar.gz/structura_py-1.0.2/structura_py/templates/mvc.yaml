  # MVC Architecture

  MVC architecture is widely used in web applications to separate concerns and improve maintainability:

  - The **controllers** handle user inputs and trigger changes in the model or view.
  - The **models** manage the data and represent the business logic.
  - The **templates** render the HTML output to display the data.
  - The **routes** define the API endpoints and routing logic.
  - The **tests** contain unit and integration tests.
