## 🚀 Deployment Options

1. **Direct Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install mssql-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/richardhan/mssql_mcp_server:latest
   ```

   cd mssql_mcp_server
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 📊 Test Execution

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
# All tests with coverage
./run_tests.py --coverage

# Specific test suites
./run_tests.py --suite unit
./run_tests.py --suite security
./run_tests.py --suite integration
./run_tests.py --suite performance

# Parallel execution
./run_tests.py --parallel
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. Use a dedicated SQL Server login with minimal permissions
2. Enable encryption for Azure SQL connections
3. Regularly update dependencies
4. Monitor security advisories
5. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## 📝 Recommendations for Production

1. **Database User**: Create a dedicated user with only necessary permissions
2. **Connection Pooling**: Consider implementing connection pooling for high-load scenarios
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting at the application level
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for database operations
5. **Backup**: Regular backups of critical data
6. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated with security patches

## ✅ Conclusion

The MSSQL MCP Server has undergone comprehensive testing covering:
- Functionality correctness
- Security robustness
- Performance efficiency
- Error resilience
- Production scalability

The automated CI/CD pipeline ensures ongoing quality and security validation. The system is ready for production deployment with appropriate security measures and monitoring in place.
