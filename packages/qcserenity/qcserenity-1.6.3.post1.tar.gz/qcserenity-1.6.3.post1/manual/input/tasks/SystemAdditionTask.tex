\subsection{Task: System-Addition}\label{task: addition}
The System-Addition Task constructs a supersystem from subsystems. The supersystem can be constructed only from the atoms of the subsystems or from atoms and occupied orbitals. Basis-set changes are allowed. Charge, spin and geometry of the supersystem may be changed.
\subsubsection{Example Input}

\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
	Aliases for this task are \ttt{ADDITIONTASK} and \ttt{ADD}
	\item[\texttt{activeSystems}]\hfill \\
	Accepts a single active system that will be used as the supersystem.
	\item[\texttt{environmentSystems}]\hfill \\
	A list of the environment systems used as the subsystems added together.
	\item[\texttt{checkSuperGeom}]\hfill \\
	Perform a cross-check to ensure that the supersystem geometry is not changed. By default \ttt{false}.
	\item[\texttt{checkSuperCharge}]\hfill \\
	Perform a cross-check to ensure that supersystem charge and spin are not changed. By default \ttt{false}.
	\item[\texttt{addOccupiedOrbitals}]\hfill \\
	Construct the supersystem occupied orbitals from the union of the subsystem orbitals. The orbital set may not be orthonormal! By default \ttt{false}.
