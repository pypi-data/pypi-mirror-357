\subsection{Task: Quasi-Restricted Orbitals}

This task allows the calculation of quasi-restricted orbitals (QROs)~\cite{Neese2006} from UHF or UKS orbitals.
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
 +task QRO

\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
 \item [\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
  Aliases for this task are \ttt{QRO} and \ttt{QUASIRESTRICTEDORBITALS}.
 \item [\texttt{activeSystems}]\hfill \\
  The system for which the QROs should be calculated.
 \item [\texttt{environmentSystems}]\hfill \\
  Environment systems may be supplied for an embedded energy/Fock matrix calculation
  for the re-canonicalization of the QROs.
 \item[\texttt{sub-blocks}]\hfill \\
  The embedding settings (\ttt{emb}) settings can be added by a sub-block. They are used for the embedded energy/Fock matrix
  calculation.
 \item [\texttt{canonicalize}]\hfill \\
  If \ttt{true} the QROs will be re-canonicalized. Doubly occupied orbitals are chosen to
  diagonalize the beta-Fock matrix, singly occupied orbitals to diagonalize (alpha-Fock + beta-Fock)/2
  and the purely virtual orbitals to diagonalize the alpha-Fock matrix.
