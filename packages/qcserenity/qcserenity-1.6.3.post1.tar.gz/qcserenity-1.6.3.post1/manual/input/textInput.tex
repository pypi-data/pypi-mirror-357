\chapter{Text Input}

The input of \serenity has two main types of sections, the \ttt{system} blocks and the \ttt{task} blocks.
A chart depicting how \serenity handles input can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:input}.
While the chart is already quite technical, it displays how to read the sectioned input.
Starting from the right, the main job of the program is to run tasks in a certain order.
These tasks can be related \textit{via} the systems they use, \textit{i.e.} a \ttt{MP2Task} will be used.
orbital data from a previous \ttt{SCFTask} if both of them are working with the same system.
Accordingly, the first part of the input has to be the system definitions which is followed by
a list of tasks to complete with these systems.
In a minimal case, the systems are just a geometry and a set of settings (such as charge, spin, basis set, and so on).
During the run these systems will be populated with more (calculated) data, such as orbitals, energies and electron densities.
This additional data can also be read from previous runs (see the following section).
Any feature that \serenity has is implemented as a task (or a part of a task).
For a list of available features/tasks, see Section~\ref{sec:tasks}.

As stated above, the text input of \serenity is structured into blocks containing the keywords.
A keyword consists of a name and a value and is always given inside of a block.
Each keyword-value pair has to be given in one separate line.
As for the blocks, there are two main types, those are \ttt{system} and \ttt{task}.
A block in the {\serenity} text input is started by a \ttt{+<blockname>} and ended with a
\ttt{-<blockname>}.
The main blocks of a simple input might thus look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
 name water
 geometry ./water.xyz
 method dft
 +dft
  functional PBE
 -dft
-system

+task scf
  system water
-task
\end{lstlisting}
While there are many settings and thus many keywords, all of them are defaulted, and
each run of the program will create a file containing all settings (even the default ones)
for restart purposes.\\
The input accepts comments just like shell scripts.
Thus, everything preceded by a hash is not parsed.
This holds for entire lines but also for parts of a line.
\begin{lstlisting}
# not parsed
+system # also not parsed
 name test
 geometry test.xyz
 # you guessed it, this is also not parsed
-system
\end{lstlisting}
The entire input (with the exception of system names and path names) is case-insensitive.
Keywords could thus look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
  gradients true
  funcTIONAL PbE0
  maxCycles 123
  NaMe water # note that the value of name is case sensitive
\end{lstlisting}
A list of values for a keyword can be parsed by enclosing them into curly brackets:
\begin{lstlisting}
  orbitals {1 2 3 4}
\end{lstlisting}
A list of settings (keywords) inside the \ttt{system} and \ttt{task} blocks will be
presented in the following two sections.
