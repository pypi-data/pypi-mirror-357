## Synopsis
Serenity is a quantum chemistry code originally
developed in the group of Johannes Neugebauer
at the University of Münster.       
Serenity has a strong focus on quantum chemical subsystem/embedding methods.

## Download

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/qcserenity/serenity/) and on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qcserenity/).


## Install

Please read the following instructions carefully.

### Installing Precompiled Binaries of the Python Interface
For CPython versions 3.7 - 3.13, wheels are available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qcserenity/). Just run
> pip install qcserenity

which installs the `qcserenity` python package. Directly in this package are some python utility functions. The pybind11 wrapper to the C++ code resides in a submodule of `qcserenity` called `serenipy`. Also see the manual and [Getting Started](#getting-started) 

### Prerequisites For Building From Source
The code has been tested and compiled on Linux with GCC/G++
(Versions 7 and newer) and Clang (Versions 8 and newer).
Compilation with other compilers such as ICC should be
possible on Linux. Old GCC/G++ compilers (4.8.5 or older)
are known to be insufficient.

Furthermore, the code has been compiled on macOS using Clang
but may experience problems depending on the CPU architecture.
Compilation with GCC on macOS should most likely also be possible.
  
Compilation on and for Windows is not supported at the moment.

The following programs/libraries must be available on your system:
 - CMake (Version >= 3.15)
 - Boost (for package managers: including boost-devel)
 - OpenMP
 - Eigen3
 - HDF5 (Version >= 1.10.1; including header files and cmake files)
 - A recent GMP version, including C++ support (for libint2)
 - The standard GNU toolchain (make, tar, autoconf, libtool)

The following libraries will be automatically downloaded and installed together
with Serenity (unless `SERENITY_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES=OFF` is set):  
 - libint2 (Version 2.7.0-beta6, pre-configured and hosted at: https://www.uni-muenster.de/Chemie.oc/THCLAB/libint)
 - libecpint (v1.0.7 from https://github.com/robashaw/libecpint.git)
 - libxc (v6.1.0 from https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc)
 - xcfun (the Serenity version is forked to: https://github.com/qcserenity/xcfun)
 - GoogleTest (v1.13.0 from https://github.com/google/googletest.git)

The following libraries are optional and needed for additional features:
 - Intel MKL (for SMP parallel Eigen3 eigenvalue solvers)
 - Doxygen (for the documentation)
 - Python-devel (for the python wrapper)
 - pybind11 (for the python wrapper)
 - laplace-minimax (for Laplace-Transform MP2/ADC(2)/CC2/GW, commit: '55414f3', https://github.com/bhelmichparis/laplace-minimax.git)

### Build From Source Using CMake and Make
Extract or pull the source code, then create a build directory:
> cd serenity  
> mkdir build  
> cd build  

Then run cmake:
> cmake ..  

To compile Serenity for your specific CPU architecture, you can add:
> cmake -DSERENITY_MARCH=native ..

To compile the Laplace-Minimax library, activate the `SERENITY_USE_LAPLACE_MINIMAX` option.
> cmake -DSERENITY_USE_LAPLACE_MINIMAX=ON

(If the build folder is not located inside the main directory of Serenity
please adapt the path accordingly.)

Finally run `make` to build the program:
> make         

Instead of additionally running `make install`, you can source `serenity.sh` located in the main folder (if `SERENITY_USAGE_FROM_SOURCE` is set, which is the default) to set all necessary environment
variables:
> cd ..  
> source serenity.sh

### Build From Source Including Python Interface
In order to activate the compilation of a Python interface to the code
a flag can be set as follows
> cmake -DSERENITY_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..

Additionally this and other flags can be toggled using `ccmake`
> ccmake ..

The wrapper will be built for the Python version that CMake finds first.
In order to point CMake to a specific version of Python the following 
option can be used:
> cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 ..

The wrapper is shipped in form of a shared library (serenipy.so).
In order for Python to find this package the library folder has to be present 
in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable and the Serenity library has to be 
present in a path searched by the system for shared libraries.
The latter is done when sourcing the `serenity.sh` script, the former requires 
to un-comment one line in this file.
Afterwards the interface should be importable as follows:
> python  
> import qcserenity.serenipy as spy

Alternatively, if you have the python packages `cibuildwheel` and `scikit-build-core` as well as Docker, you can build the python wheels yourself by simply invoking `cibuildwheel` in the Serenity main folder.

### Tests
Serenity comes with a decent set of unittests; in order to run them, source 
the `serenity.sh` script and run
> serenity_tests
  
The Python wrapper comes with its own set of tests, these can be run using
> python -m unittest discover PATH_TO_SERENITY/qcserenity/tests

or alternatively inside a python environment
> from qcserenity.tests import *
> run_all_tests()

### Documentation
After configuring the project using CMake it is possible to create the documentation 
using:
> make doc  

Then you can open up the doc/html/index.html in a browser.  
The python wrapper is not featured inside the documentation.
Its documentation is available via pythons help() function,
which displays the built-in doc-strings.

### Troubleshooting:
If you run into trouble during the compilation please make sure all
required libraries are present and read the output carfully.
If you can make sure that your problems are not due to lacking requirements
feel free to contact the main developers or preferably open an issue in the 
repository.

## User Manual
The user manual resides in a separate folder (manual) in this repository.

## Getting Started
After building from source, `test.input` lies in the main directory. After sourcing `serenity.sh`, the first calculation can be performed by running
> serenity test.input

which will generate some output and also a folder called `hydrogen` in the directory from which `serenity` is executed.

In case `qcserenity` was installed via `pip`, the first calculation can be run like this:
> python3  
> from qcserenity.serenipy import *  
> settings = Settings()  
> settings.geometry = "data/xyzfiles/h2.xyz"  
> settings.method = DFT  
> settings.dft.functional = PBE  
> 
> sys = System(settings)  
> scf = ScfTask_R(sys)  
> scf.run()
