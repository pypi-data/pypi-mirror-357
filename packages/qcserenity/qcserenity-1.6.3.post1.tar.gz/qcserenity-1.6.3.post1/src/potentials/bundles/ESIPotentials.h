 * @class ESIPotentials ESIPotentials.h
 * @brief The electrostatic interaction potentials/energies bundled into one class.
 *
 * This class combines the description of the following interactions between one
 * active system and a multitude of environment systems:
 *  - the nuclear-electron interactions
 *    (both active nucleii with env. electrons and active electrons with env. nucleii)
 *  - the Coulomb repulsion between the active electrons and all environment electrons
 *    (excluding electron-electron repulsion within and between the different
 *     environment systems)
 *  - the Coulomb repulsion between the active system nucleii and the environment nucleii
 *    (excluding nucleus-nucleus repulsion within and between the different
 *     environment systems)
 *  - due to the technical relation of Coulomb and HF-exchange contributions
 *    this class also allows for a consideration of exchange interactions.
 *    (Please see the appropriate constructor for more information.)
