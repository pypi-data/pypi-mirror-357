/**
 * @class NotifyingClass NotifyingClass.h
 * @brief Counterpart to ObjectSensitiveClass, template for classes which notify those.
 *
 * Also read the information about ObjectSensitiveClass and the corresponding entry in the wiki
 * (Concepts: Notification).\n
 * Whenever you need to inform other objects about changes in data your class is managing, it
 * should inherit from NotifyingClass<T>, where T is the type of the managed data object (e.g.
 * DensityOnGrid). After your an object of your class changed something in the managed data, it
 * has to call this->notifyObjects() for the notification system to work. Make sure that the
 * ObjectSensitiveClass<T> objects are actually signed in to this (i.e. they were given as an
 * argument in a call to this->addSensitiveObject()).\n
 *
 * Example:\n
 * We will work with some data class Foo. Now we will construct a Controller for it. This
 * controller will also inform other objects (if signed in) about changes that may happen.\n
 *
 * class FooController : public NotifyingClass<Foo> {
 * public:
 *   FooController() : _foo(nullptr), _upToDate(false) {}
 *   void makeInvalid() {
 *     // Something happens which invalidates _foo
 *     notifyObjects();
 *   }
 *   const Foo& getFoo() {
 *     if (!_upToDate) updateFoo();
 *     return *_foo;
 *   }
 * private:
 *   void updateFoo() {
 *     // Create or update the controlled foo object
 *     // ...
 *     _upToDate = true;
 *   }
 *   std::unique_ptr<Foo> _foo;
 *   void _upToDate;
 * };
 * \n
 * This construction will make sure that when calling getFoo() the result is always upToDate.
 * Any object that is signed in to the FooController (see ObjectSensitiveClass) will be
 * informed about a change. But only when a new/updated Foo is actually requested, the probably
 * expensive updateFoo() function is called.
