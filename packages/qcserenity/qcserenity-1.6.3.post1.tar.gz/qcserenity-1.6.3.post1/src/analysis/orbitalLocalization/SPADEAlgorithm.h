 *
 *  The SPADE algorithm effectively localizes the supersystem orbitals such that
 *  a subset is mostly localized on the active system. The orbitals may be
 *  delocalized over the complete, respective fragment. The singular values
 *  associated to the localized orbitals are commonly used for the orbital
 *  partitioning. The algorithm suggests a number of orbitals that should be
 *  assigned to the active system.
