 * @brief Manages the convergence acceleration methods for Freeze-and-Thaw (FaT) calculations.
 *
 * Currently implemented:\n
 *      - DIIS\n
 * \n
 *
 * DIIS:\n
 *   Perform DIIS procedure on top of the FaT calculation for the density matrices.
 *   The supersystem density matrix for a FaT calculation is given by a block diagonal matrix with the density matrices
 *   of the subsystems as the diagonal blocks. The error associated with a not fully relaxed density matrix is given by
 * the commutator \f$[F,P]\f$ which is a block diagonal matrix as well.\n Both matrices are mapped to a vector and
 * optimized using a standard DIIS (math/diis/DIIS.h) and then mapped back to their matrix formulation before the
 * density matrices of the subsystems are updated. For more information about the DIIS procedure see math/diis/DIIS.h.\n
