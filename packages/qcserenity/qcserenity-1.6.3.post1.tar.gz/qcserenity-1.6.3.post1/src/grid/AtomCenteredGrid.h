 * @brief Atom-centered version of a numerical integration grid.
 *
 * Most integration grids used in calculations are constructed as a combination of grids for
 * the atoms of the system. However, also other grids (e.g. cubical grids for plotting) are
 * used sometimes. This AtomCenteredGrid stores the contributions of the different atoms to
 * this grid additionally to the normal grid information.\n
 *
 * A similar design exists for the Basis.
