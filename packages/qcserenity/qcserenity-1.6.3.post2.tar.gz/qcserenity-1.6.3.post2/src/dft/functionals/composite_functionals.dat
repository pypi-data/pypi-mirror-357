# ===============================================================
#
#  This file contains the names of all composite functionals
#  known to Serenity. Each of these functionals has to appear
#  in the functional_definitions.dat as well.
#
#  The functionals are listed with
#  1. Their name (unique, translated into an enum member)
#  2. Their class (XC, K or NONE)
#  3. Their string representations/aliases
#     (the first one always being the literal enum name).
