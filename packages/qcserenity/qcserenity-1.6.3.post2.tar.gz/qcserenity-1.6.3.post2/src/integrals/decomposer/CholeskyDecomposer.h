/**
 * @class CholeskyDecomposer CholeskyDecomposer.h
 *
 * @brief The class that performs the pivoted, incomplete Cholesky decomposition of a
 * given matrix. The matrix is provided via the lambda function
 * matrixColumnCalculator, which returns elements of the matrix that correspond
 * to the qualifiedSet(rows) and reducedSet(columns).
 *
 * The pivoting algorithm orders the columns to decompose according to their
 * significance(magnitude of diagonal element) and assures numerical stability.
 *
 * The incomplete decomposition guarantees a fast decomposition combined with a
 * guarantee that the original matrix can be reconstructed with an error that is
 * smaller than the _decompositionThreshold.
 *
 * This corresponds to a modification of the algorithm described in
 * "Francesco Aquilante, T. P., Linear-scaling Techniques in Computational Chem-
 * istry and Physics; Springer Netherlands: 2011; Vol. 13, pp 301â€“343"
 *
 * For the detailed algorithm check the manual.
