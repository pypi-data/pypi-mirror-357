 * @class ResponseSolver
 * @brief A class for the iterative solution of the response problem (in the form of a linear system).\n
 *
 * For undamped response problems (frequency is purely real) it utilizes a modified OJJ-Algorithm\n
 * as proposed by Filip Furche in his PhD thesis.\n
 * (F. Furche, GÃ¶ttingen 2002. Fak. f. Chemie, Diss. v. 1.2.2002., PhD thesis, 2002.)\n
 *
 * For damped response problems (frequency is complex) it utilizes a modified OJJ-Algorithm adapted\n
 * for this purpose (see Niklas' Master Thesis for further reference).
 *
 * AR: Caution! This class respects only the first three columns of the right-hand side matrix ppmq. See the seed()
 * function
