/**
 * @class EigenvalueSolver
 * @brief A class for the iterative solution of the response eigenvalue problem.\n
 *
 * This class includes solution techniques for Hermitian and symplectic eigenvalue\n
 * problems, as required by (Hybrid-) TDDFT.\n
 *
 * For Hermitian problems, the standard Davidson-Liu algorithm will be used and for\n
 * symplectic problems a modified OJJ-Algorithm as proposed by Filip Furche in his\n
 * PhD thesis.\n
 * (F. Furche, GÃ¶ttingen 2002. Fak. f. Chemie, Diss. v. 1.2.2002., PhD thesis, 2002.)\n
 *
 * Note that the Hermitian solver utilizes non-orthonormal guess spaces for\n
 * convergence acceleration. (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016 12 (7), 3003-3007)

   * @param convergenceCriterion If the norm of a residual vector of a root falls beneath this
   *        threshold, the root will be considered converged.
   * @param maxIterations If not converged after this number of iterations, abort.
   * @param maxSubspaceDimension Will perform a subspace collapse if the number of guess vectors

   * @param initialSubspace Multiplied with nEigen to obtain the size of the initial subspace
   *        (usually two or three is a common choice).
   * @param algorithm Variable to tell the eigenvalue solver which kind of TDDFT problem is to be solved
   *        to apply the according solution technique.
   * @param sigmaCalculator A lambda to conveniently form response matrix -- guess vector products.\n
   *        Takes a set of guessvectors as an argument and returns a pointer to the sigmavectors.
   * @param initialGuess The initial guess space might also be passed to the eigenvalue solver.
   * @param writeToDisk A lambda function to store temporary iteration data to disk.
