\subsection{Task: Transition-State Geometry Optimization}
This task performs transition-state geometry optimizations. Has to be provided with one guess structure for the transition state (act) and can additionally be given structures of both minima on the potential-energy surface (env).
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
+task TS
  act water
-task

\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
  \item [\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
    Aliases for this task are \ttt{TSTask}, \ttt{TSOpt} and \ttt{TS}.
  \item [\texttt{activeSystem}]\hfill \\
    Transition state to be optimized.
  \item [\texttt{environmentSystems}]\hfill \\
    Structures of minima on the potential energy surface.
  \item [\texttt{lst}]\hfill \\
    Specifies if LST is performed before QST. Default is \ttt{false}.
  \item [\texttt{lstqstonly}]\hfill \\
    Specifies that only LST/QST should be done and NO Bofill TS-search afterwards. Default is \ttt{false}.
  \item [\texttt{normalmode}]\hfill \\
    Specifies the reaction coordinate along which the TS is searched. Default is \ttt{1}.
