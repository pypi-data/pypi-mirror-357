\subsection{Task: Electronic-Structure Copy}
This task copies the first active system to all environment systems by rotating the
orbitals to their internal frames. All systems should have the same atoms ordered
in the same way.
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
 +task ESC
  act waterAct
  env waterEnv1
  env waterEnv2
  env waterEnv3
 -task
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
  Aliases for this task are \ttt{ELECTRONICSTRUCTURECOPYTASK}, \ttt{COPY}, and \ttt{ESC}.
\item [\texttt{activeSystems}]\hfill \\
  The source system to be used.
\item [\texttt{environmentSystems}]\hfill \\
  The target systems to which the orbitals are to be copied.
\item [\texttt{atomFrameIndices}]\hfill \\
  The atom indices used for the internal frame construction.
  If none are given, the first three atoms are used.
\item [\texttt{orthogonalize}]\hfill \\
  Orthogonalize the orbitals after copying using a
  LÃ¶wdin orthogonalization. \ttt{false} by default.
\item [\texttt{copyCharges}]\hfill \\
  Change the charges/spins of the environment systems
  to the charge/spin of the active system. \ttt{true} by default.
