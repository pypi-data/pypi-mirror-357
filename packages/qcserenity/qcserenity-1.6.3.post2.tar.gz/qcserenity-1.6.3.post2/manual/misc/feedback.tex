\chapter{Bugs, Feedback and Feature Requests}
Bug reports and feature requests for the \serenity code can and should be communicated \textit{via} the issue tracker included in the
repository. Please open issues for features requests and bugs, only after checking if the same issue or feature has already been requested/reported.
Both feature requests and bugs can be labeled as such within the issue tracking system.\\
\\
In the case of bug reports and problems the developers are most likely to answer to these issues, as they are logged and will also help for future questions, because they
are archived. \\
\\
Feature requests will be open for discussion and if they are popular or small enough they are likely to be added to the code.
For this reason please keep feature requests simple or add tasks to them so it is simple to see and discuss the missing pieces and spot
synergies with other projects.
(Of course it is also possible to provide a pull/merge request and contribute a specific feature to the code yourself.)\\
\\
In the case of general feedback and questions or specific comments about the manual's text feel free to contact the developers or authors directly.
