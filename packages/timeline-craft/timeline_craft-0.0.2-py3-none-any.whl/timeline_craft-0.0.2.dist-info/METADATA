    path_ppt = Path("/Users/donyin/Desktop/example.pptx")
    tags = ["Intro"] * 33

    example_ppt = Presentation(path_ppt)

    move_elements_to_right(example_ppt, sidebar_width=0.12)

```

# Disclaimer
This project is under development, with further refinements and feature additions in progress. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. This is probably the dirtiest piece of code I have written, and I blame it on python-pptx, on which this project, out of no other choice, is based. Although useful it is a horrible package with irregular syntax and poor documentation.
