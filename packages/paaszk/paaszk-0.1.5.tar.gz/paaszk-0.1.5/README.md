# üîê PaasZK ‚Äì Secure Vault Sync CLI

![Project Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrorodrigues1997/PaaSZK/main/logo.png)

**PaasZK** is a lightweight, CLI-based encrypted vault system that lets you safely store and sync confidential files across cloud providers. It supports encrypted file storage, cloud synchronization, and backend storage abstraction ‚Äî all under your control.

---

## üîí Purpose

PaasZK was built to:

- **Encrypt your sensitive files** locally using strong AES encryption.
- **Store and synchronize** encrypted files across multiple cloud storage providers (S3, Dropbox, Google Drive).
- Allow **easy configuration** of storage backends using a secure YAML config file.


---

## üõ°Ô∏è Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: From passphrase using your master key loading mechanism.
- **Config & metadata** are stored in an encrypted YAML file using AES-GCM with random IV and authentication tag.

AES-GCM provides **authenticated encryption**, meaning it protects both the **confidentiality** and **integrity** of your data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new vault in the current directory
paaszk init [--import-key PATH]
##Sets up the current directory as a new encrypted vault.

## --import-key PATH: Optional path to an existing encrypted derived master key to import instead of generating a new one.

# Encrypt and push encrypted files to remote storage
paaszk push [FILE_OR_FOLDER] [--storage STORAGE_NAME] [--recursive]
##Encrypt and upload files to your configured storage.

##Defaults to current directory if no file/folder specified.

##--storage STORAGE_NAME: Specify which storage backend to use.

##--recursive: If pushing a directory, recursively include all subfiles.


# Pull remote encrypted files into vault
paaszk pull --storage STORAGE_NAME
##Download and decrypt all files from the specified storage backend into your local cache.

# Configure storages
paaszk config <command> [options]
#Available subcommands:

 #   list: List all configured storage backends.

paaszk config list [--yaml]

  #  --yaml: Output the raw YAML config.


#add: Add a new storage backend.

paaszk config add NAME

 #   NAME: The name to assign the new storage backend.

#remove: Remove an existing storage backend.

paaszk config remove NAME

 #   NAME: The storage backend to remove

----------------------------------------------------
#Initialize a vault and import an existing key:

paaszk init --import-key ./my_derived_key.enc

#Push all files from current folder recursively to Dropbox backend:

paaszk push . --storage dropbox --recursive

#Pull all files from the Google Drive backend:

paaszk pull --storage google_drive

#Add a new S3 storage backend called my_s3:

paaszk config add my_s3

#List all storage backends in YAML format:

paaszk config list --yaml
