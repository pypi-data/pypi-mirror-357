**Ground Control** is a sleek, real-time terminal-based system monitor built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), [Plotext](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext) and the [nvitop API](https://terminaltrove.com/nvitop/). It provides a powerful, aesthetic, customizable interface for tracking CPU, memory, disk, network, and GPU usage — all in a visually appealing and responsive TUI.

**Ground Control** works optimally with [TMUX](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), install it [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing)!

We tested **Ground Control** with the *Windows Terminal* app, *Tabby* and the *VSCode integrated terminal*. Monospaced fonts are preferred.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔹 Install via PyPI
```sh
pip install groundcontrol
```

### 🔹 Install from Source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/alberto-rota/ground-control
cd ground-control
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔹 Run Ground Control
Once installed, simply launch Ground Control with:
```sh
groundcontrol
```

Or run as a Python module:
```sh
python -m ground_control
```
### 🔹 Available Layouts

### Grid Layout
A structured layout displaying all widgets neatly in a grid. When you first launch **Ground Control**, it will show this layout.

### Horizontal Layout
All widgets aligned in a single row. If you like working with wide shell spaces, split a TMUX session horizontally and use this layout!
![Horizontal Layout](https://github.com/alberto-rota/ground-control/blob/main/assets/horiz.png?raw=true)

#### Vertical Layout
A column-based layout, ideal for narrow shell spaces. If you like working with tall shell spaces, split a TMUX session verticall and use this layout!

### 🖥️ Widget Breakdown
Each panel in Ground Control represents a different system metric:

### 🔹 **CPU & Memory**
- Shows real-time per-core CPU usage.
- Displays RAM usage with a visual bar.

## 🛠️ Configuring Ground Control
You might not want to see all the widgets all at once. To select which widgets you want Ground Control to show, press `c` or the `Configure` button. You'll see a selection panel that yuu can use to toggle the widgets shown. 
Press `c` again to hide the configuration panel

You can switch to a grid, horizontal or verical layout with `g`, `h` or `v` or use the `Grid Layout`, `Horizontal Layout` or `Vertical Layout` buttons.


![Config_widget](https://github.com/alberto-rota/ground-control/blob/main/assets/config.png?raw=true)

This configurations are saved when you quit Ground Control, so when you launch it again you will see the same layout!

All available keyboard shortcuts are listed here:
| Key  | Action |
|------|--------|
| `h`  | Switch to Horizontal Layout |
| `v`  | Switch to Vertical Layout |
| `g`  | Switch to Grid Layout |
| `c`  | Show/Hide the configuration panel |
| `q`  | Quit Ground Control |

---

**Ground Control** saves user preferences in a configuration file located at:
`
~/.config/ground-control/config.json
`.
Modify this file in your default text editor with
```sh
groundcontrol config
```

## ⛔ Current Known Limitations/Bugs
- GPU usage is monitored only for CUDA-enabled hardware. Ground Control detects MiG devices but in some cases it cannot detect their utilization. You'll see *Usage UNAV* in the GPU Widget if this is the case
- Disk I/O is currently reported from `psutil.disk_io_counters()` and `psutil.disk_usage('/')`. This measurements do not account for partitions / unmounted disks / more-than-disk configuration. See [Issue #4](https://github.com/alberto-rota/ground-control/issues/4)
