.SS NAME
hid\-replay \- HID input device replay through uhid
.SS SYNOPSIS
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] [\-\-verbose] [FILENAME]
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]\-\-verbose\f[R]
Enable debugging output
.SS DESCRIPTION
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] creates a virtual HID device based on the recorded
file, usually recorded by \f[B]hid\-recorder(1)\f[R].
This device behaves as if it was physically connected to the system.
Any events in the recorded file are replayed in realtime.
.PP
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] is a low\-level debugging tool.
It uses the \f[B]uhid\f[R] kernel model to create the device and all
data is processed by the respective HID kernel module for the device.
.PP
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] needs to be able to write to \f[I]/dev/uhid\f[R];
usually this means it must be run as root.
.SS FILE FORMAT
Files supported by \f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] have the following syntax:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]#\f[R] comment lines are ignored when parsing
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]D:\f[R] the device index, only used when recording multiple devices
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]R:\f[R] The report descriptor length in bytes, followed by the
report descriptor bytes in hexadecimal
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]N:\f[R] the name of the device
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]P:\f[R] physical path
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]I:\f[R] bus vendor_id product_id
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]E:\f[R] timestamp size report in hexadecimal
.SS CAUTION
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] is a very low level events injector.
To have the virtual device handled by the correct HID kernel module,
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] fakes that the device is on the original bus (USB,
I2C or BT).
Thus, if the kernel module in use has to write \f[I]back\f[R] to the
device the kernel may oops if the module is trying to directly talk to
the physical layer.
.PP
Ensure to use this program with friendly HID modules that rely only on
the generic hid callbacks.
.SS EXIT CODE
\f[B]hid\-replay\f[R] returns 1 on error.
