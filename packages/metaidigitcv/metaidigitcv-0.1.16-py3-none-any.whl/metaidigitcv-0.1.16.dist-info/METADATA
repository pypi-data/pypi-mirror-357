## 🚀 Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition with metaidigitcv

**metaidigitcv** is an advanced computer vision and machine learning library designed to detect, track, and analyze hand keypoints using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. Whether you're building interactive applications, gesture-based controls, or AI-powered hand recognition systems, metaidigitcv simplifies the process with efficient hand tracking and keypoint extraction.

---

## 🔥 Features

✅ **Hand Detection** – Accurately detects multiple hands in real-time.  
✅ **Landmark Tracking** – Tracks 21 keypoints per hand.  
✅ **Finger Recognition** – Identifies raised fingers for gesture recognition.  
✅ **Distance Measurement** – Computes distance between two keypoints.  
✅ **Angle Calculation** – Calculates the angle (in degrees) between three 3D points. 
✅ **Text Overlay with Background** – Draws text on the image with a customizable background rectangle..
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Uses MediaPipe for fast processing.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install metaidigitcv
```

Ensure you have **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
import cv2
from metaidigitcv.main import Handtracker

# Initialize the tracker
detector = Handtracker()

# Capture video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    success, img = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
    
    hands, img = detector.identifyHands(img)
    if hands:
        lmList = hands[0]["lmList"]  # List of hand landmarks
        print("Thumb Tip Position:", lmList[4])
    
    cv2.imshow("Hand Tracking", img)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## ✨ Key Functions

### 🖐 Hand Detection
```python
hands, img = detector.identifyHands(img, draw=True)
```
- Detects hands in an image/video frame.
- Draws hand landmarks if `draw=True`.

### 🏷️ Landmark Extraction
```python
lmList, bbox = detector.trackPosition(img)
```
- Returns a list of hand landmark positions.
- Provides the bounding box of the detected hand.

### ✋ Finger State Detection
```python
fingers = detector.trackRaisedFingers(hands[0])
```
- Returns a list `[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]` where `1` means the finger is up.

### 📏 Distance Calculation
```python
length, img, points = detector.trackDistance(4, 8, img)
```
- Measures the Euclidean distance between two keypoints (e.g., thumb and index finger).

### 📏 Angle Calculation
```python
angle = detector.calculate_angle(point_a_coords, point_b_coords, point_c_coords)
```
- Calculates the angle (in degrees) between three 3D points, with point_b_coords as the vertex.
- point_a_coords, point_b_coords, point_c_coords should be lists or tuples of [x, y] coordinates from lmList.

### 📏 Text Overlay with Background
```python
img_with_text = detector.putTextRect(img, "Hand Detected!", (50, 100), scale=1, thickness=1, 
                                     colorT=(255, 255, 255), colorR=(255, 0, 255), offset=10)
```
- Draws text on the image with a customizable background rectangle.
- Enhances text readability, especially on busy backgrounds.
