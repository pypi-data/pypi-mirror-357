## When to Use Each Approach

### LLM Evaluators (Recommended For)

LLM evaluators excel in scenarios requiring flexibility and rapid iteration. Use them during development and prototyping when evaluation criteria are still evolving. They're particularly effective for subjective assessments where human-like judgment is valuable.

**Ideal use cases:**
- Early development phases with changing requirements
- Complex, nuanced evaluations requiring reasoning
- Low-volume evaluations (< 10,000 per day)
- Scenarios where explainability is critical
- Multi-dimensional quality assessments

**Example scenario:** Evaluating whether customer service responses are empathetic and helpful requires understanding context and tone that LLM evaluators handle well.

### Finetuned Classifiers (Recommended For)

Finetuned classifiers provide superior performance for well-defined, objective tasks at scale. They offer millisecond-level latency and consistent results, making them ideal for production guardrails.

**Ideal use cases:**
- Production environments with high volume (> 100,000 per day)
- Well-defined binary classification tasks
- Latency-sensitive applications (< 100ms requirement)
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Stable evaluation criteria unlikely to change

**Example scenario:** Detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in responses benefits from a finetuned classifier's speed and precision.

## Expected Failure Modes and Mitigation Strategies

### LLM Evaluator Failure Modes

Research has identified several systematic failure modes in LLM evaluators that you should anticipate and mitigate.

#### 1. Position Bias (25-89% reversal rate)
LLM evaluators reverse their pairwise preferences when ordering changes. GPT-4 shows 25% reversal rate, GPT-3.5 shows 58%, and Llama shows 89% (ACL 2024).

**Mitigation:** Randomize response ordering and run multiple evaluations with different positions. Average the results or use the more conservative estimate.

```python
# Example mitigation in ACP Evals
from acp_evals.evaluators import BinaryEvaluator

class PositionRobustEvaluator(BinaryEvaluator):
    async def evaluate_pair(self, response_a, response_b):
        # Evaluate both orders
        result_1 = await self.evaluate(f"A: {response_a}\nB: {response_b}")
        result_2 = await self.evaluate(f"A: {response_b}\nB: {response_a}")
        
        # Return conservative result
        return result_1 if result_1.confidence < result_2.confidence else result_2
```

#### 2. Verbosity Bias (>90% preference for longer responses)
Both GPT-3.5 and Claude-v1 prefer longer responses over 90% of the time, even when shorter responses are more accurate or clear.

**Mitigation:** Normalize for length or explicitly instruct the evaluator to ignore response length. Add length penalties to your evaluation criteria.

```python
# Configure evaluator to ignore length
evaluator = FactualAccuracyEvaluator(
    criteria="Evaluate accuracy regardless of response length. Brevity is valuable."
)
```

#### 3. Low Recall for Defects (~30-60% detection rate)
LLM evaluators identify only 30-60% of factual inconsistencies while maintaining high precision (>95%) for correct content. This asymmetry means they miss many errors.

**Mitigation:** Use multiple evaluators in ensemble (Panel of LLMs approach) or lower decision thresholds for critical applications.

```python
from acp_evals.metrics import evaluate_evaluator_performance

# Monitor evaluator performance
results = [(predicted, actual) for predicted, actual in evaluation_history]
metrics, recommendations = evaluate_evaluator_performance(
    results, 
    metric_focus="recall"  # Optimize for catching defects
)

if metrics.recall < 0.7:
    print("Warning: Low defect detection rate")
    print(recommendations)
```

#### 4. Self-Enhancement Bias (10-25% preference for own outputs)
Models prefer their own outputs with GPT-4 showing 10% bias and Claude-v1 showing 25% bias. Recent research (2025) identifies this as "preference leakage" contamination.

**Mitigation:** Use a different model for evaluation than generation, or use multiple evaluators from different providers.

### Finetuned Classifier Failure Modes

#### 1. Poor Generalization to New Domains
Finetuned evaluators trained on specific datasets show catastrophic performance drops when applied to different evaluation schemes or domains.

**Mitigation:** Maintain separate classifiers for each domain or use LLM evaluators during domain transitions.

#### 2. Distribution Shift Sensitivity
Performance degrades rapidly when input distribution changes from training data.

**Mitigation:** Implement continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines:

```python
# Monitor distribution shift
from acp_evals.metrics import calculate_distribution_shift

# Track model performance over time
performance_history = []
for batch in evaluation_batches:
    metrics = evaluate_classifier(batch)
    performance_history.append(metrics)
    
    # Check for performance degradation
    if metrics.accuracy < baseline_accuracy * 0.9:
        print("Warning: Significant performance drop detected")
        # Trigger retraining pipeline
```

## Performance Benchmarks and Expectations

### Cohen's Kappa Interpretation
Research shows Cohen's kappa as the most reliable metric for evaluator agreement:

- **κ < 0.4**: Poor agreement - evaluator not suitable for production
- **κ = 0.4-0.6**: Moderate agreement - acceptable for development
- **κ = 0.6-0.8**: Good agreement - suitable for most production uses
- **κ > 0.8**: Excellent agreement - matches human-level performance

### Expected Performance by Task Type

**Objective Tasks (Factual Accuracy, Safety)**
- LLM Evaluators: κ = 0.6-0.8, with binary outputs outperforming Likert scales (Yan et al., 2024)
- Binary QAG approach: Improved interpretability through yes/no questions (2025 research)
- Finetuned Classifiers: κ = 0.8-0.95 when properly trained

**Subjective Tasks (Tone, Helpfulness)**
- LLM Evaluators: κ = 0.4-0.6, benefits from structured prompts over pairwise comparison
- Likert scales: Median-based scoring reduces noise but requires normalization (2025)
- Finetuned Classifiers: κ = 0.3-0.5, struggles with nuance

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### Transitioning from Development to Production

Start with LLM evaluators during development to understand your evaluation needs. Collect evaluation data including both passes and failures. Once you have 10,000+ labeled examples and stable criteria, consider training a classifier.

```python
# Development phase: LLM evaluator with logging
evaluator = FactualAccuracyEvaluator(model="gpt-4")
results = []

async def evaluate_with_logging(input, response):
    result = await evaluator.evaluate(input, response)
    results.append({
        "input": input,
        "response": response, 
        "label": result.label,
        "confidence": result.confidence
    })
    return result

# After collecting data, analyze readiness for classifier
from acp_evals.metrics import BinaryClassificationCalculator

calc = BinaryClassificationCalculator()
# Split data and evaluate LLM consistency
metrics = calc.calculate_metrics(
    predictions=[r["label"] for r in results[:500]],
    ground_truth=[r["label"] for r in results[500:1000]]
)

if metrics.cohen_kappa > 0.8:
    print("LLM evaluator is consistent - ready to train classifier")
```

### Hybrid Approaches

The most robust production systems use both approaches strategically:

1. **Finetuned classifier for first-pass filtering** (high recall, low precision)
2. **LLM evaluator for borderline cases** (high precision, explainable)
3. **Human review for disagreements** (ground truth, continuous improvement)

This hybrid approach balances latency, cost, and accuracy while maintaining explainability for critical decisions.

## Cost and Latency Considerations

**LLM Evaluators:**
- Latency: 500-2000ms per evaluation
- Cost: $0.01-0.10 per 1000 evaluations (varies by model)
- Suitable for < 10,000 daily evaluations

**Finetuned Classifiers:**
- Latency: 10-50ms per evaluation  
- Cost: $0.001-0.01 per 1000 evaluations
- Suitable for millions of daily evaluations

## Latest Research Insights (2025)

Recent studies emphasize several key developments:

1. **Binary Outputs**: Research confirms binary evaluation (pass/fail) outperforms Likert scales for most tasks
2. **Question-Answer Generation (QAG)**: Using binary yes/no questions improves interpretability
3. **Preference Leakage**: New contamination risks identified when evaluators share training data with generators
4. **Human Agreement**: State-of-the-art LLMs achieve 85% alignment with human judgment (humans agree 81%)

## Conclusion

Choose LLM evaluators for flexibility and explainability during development or for complex subjective tasks. Transition to finetuned classifiers for objective, high-volume production use cases where latency and cost matter. Monitor performance continuously using classification metrics, particularly Cohen's kappa, and be prepared to adapt your approach as requirements evolve.

Remember that the best evaluation strategy often combines both approaches, using each where it excels while mitigating their respective weaknesses through careful system design.
