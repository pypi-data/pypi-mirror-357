# QtPy-EqualizerBar


This is a stripped down fork of the original [python-qtwidgets](https://github.com/pythonguis/python-qtwidgets) for the needs of my own projects
I have removed all widgets other than the EqualizerBar, and the code had been ported to use QtPy for compatibillity across PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6.
