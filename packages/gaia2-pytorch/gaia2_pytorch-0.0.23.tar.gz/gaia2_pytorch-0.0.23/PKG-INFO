## Gaia2 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of the [world model architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20523) proposed for the domain of self driving out of Wayve

Please let me know your thoughts of the paper [here](https://discord.gg/na5MQBUJqb), positive or negative, so I can gauge its significance / prioritize

## Install

```bash
$ pip install gaia2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from gaia2_pytorch import VideoTokenizer, Gaia2

video = torch.randn(1, 3, 10, 16, 16)

tokenizer = VideoTokenizer()

loss = tokenizer(video)
loss.backward()

gaia2 = Gaia2(tokenizer)

loss = gaia2(video)
loss.backward()

generated = gaia2.generate((10, 16, 16))
assert generated.shape == video.shape
```

## Contributing

```bash
$ pip install '.[test]'
```

Then add a test to `tests` and run the following

```bash
$ pytest tests
```

That's it
