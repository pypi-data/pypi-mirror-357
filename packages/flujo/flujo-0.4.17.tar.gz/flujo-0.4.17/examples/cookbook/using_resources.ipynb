        "3.  We instantiate our resources *once* and pass the `shared_resources` object to the `Flujo` constructor.\n",
        "4.  When the engine executes the `lookup_user` step, it inspects the agent's `run` method signature, sees the `resources` parameter, and passes the shared object to it.\n",
        "5.  The agent can then use the methods on the injected object (e.g., `resources.db_conn.get_user_by_id`)."
