# flujo

Production-ready orchestration for Pydantic-based AI agents with intelligent evaluation and self-improvement capabilities.

## Overview

The `flujo` is a powerful Python library that provides a structured approach to building and managing multi-agent AI workflows. Built on top of Pydantic for type safety and data validation, it offers both high-level orchestration patterns and flexible pipeline construction tools.

## Features

- **üîß Pydantic Native** ‚Äì Everything from agents to pipeline context is defined with Pydantic models for reliable type safety
- **üéØ Opinionated & Flexible** ‚Äì Start with the built-in `Default` recipe for common patterns or compose custom flows using the Pipeline DSL
- **üöÄ Production Ready** ‚Äì Built-in retries, telemetry, scoring, and quality controls help you deploy reliable systems
- **üß† Intelligent Evals** ‚Äì Automated evaluation and self-improvement powered by LLMs
- **‚ö° High Performance** ‚Äì Async-first design with efficient concurrent execution
- **üîå Extensible** ‚Äì Plugin system for custom validation, scoring, and tools

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install flujo
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from flujo.recipes import Default
from flujo import (
    Task,
    review_agent, solution_agent, validator_agent, reflection_agent,
    init_telemetry,
)

# Initialize telemetry (optional)
init_telemetry()

# Create the default recipe with built-in agents
orch = Default(
    review_agent=review_agent,
    solution_agent=solution_agent,
    validator_agent=validator_agent,
    reflection_agent=reflection_agent,
)

# Define and run a task
task = Task(prompt="Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers")
result = orch.run_sync(task)

if result:
    print(f"Solution: {result.solution}")
    print(f"Quality Score: {result.score}")
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Solve a task quickly
flujo solve "Create a REST API for a todo app"

# Run benchmarks
flujo bench "Write a sorting algorithm" --rounds 5

# Show configuration
flujo show-config

# Generate improvement suggestions
flujo improve pipeline.py dataset.py
```

## Core Concepts

- **Default recipe**: High-level coordinator for standard multi-agent workflows
- **Pipeline DSL**: Flexible system for building custom agent workflows
- **Agents**: Specialized AI models with specific roles (review, solution, validation, reflection)
- **Tasks**: Input specifications with prompts and metadata
- **Candidates**: Generated solutions with quality assessments
- **Scoring**: Multiple strategies for evaluating solution quality
- **Telemetry**: Built-in monitoring and observability

## Architecture

The library follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Application Layer**: Default recipe, Flujo engine, and high-level coordination
- **Domain Layer**: Core models, pipeline DSL, and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Agents, settings, telemetry, and external integrations
- **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface for common operations
