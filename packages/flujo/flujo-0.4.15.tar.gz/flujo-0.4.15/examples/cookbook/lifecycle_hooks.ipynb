   "source": "### How It Works\n\n1.  We define two hooks: `simple_logger_hook` and `abort_on_failure_hook`. Both are `async def` functions that accept `**kwargs`.\n2.  We register these hooks by passing them in a list to the `Flujo` constructor.\n3.  As the pipeline runs, the `Flujo` engine calls every registered hook for each event (`pre_run`, `pre_step`, etc.). The `simple_logger_hook` prints the name of each event as it happens.\n4.  The `failing_step`'s agent raises a `RuntimeError`. The engine catches this, marks the step as failed, and then fires the `on_step_failure` event.\n5.  Our `abort_on_failure_hook` receives this event, checks the event name, and raises `PipelineAbortSignal`.\n6.  The engine catches this special signal and gracefully terminates the entire run, returning the partial `PipelineResult`."
