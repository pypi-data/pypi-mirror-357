The engine will then track the cumulative cost and token count after each step and automatically halt the pipeline if a limit is breached."

   "source": "### How It Works\n\n1.  We define `UsageLimits` with `total_cost_usd_limit=0.12`.\n2.  The `Flujo` runner receives these limits.\n3.  **Step 1** runs, costing $0.05. The total cost is $0.05, which is less than $0.12. The pipeline continues.\n4.  **Step 2** runs, costing another $0.05. The total cost is now $0.10, which is still less than $0.12. The pipeline continues.\n5.  **Step 3** runs, costing $0.05. The total cost becomes $0.15.\n6.  *After* Step 3 completes, the engine checks the total cost ($0.15), sees it has breached the limit ($0.12), and immediately raises `UsageLimitExceededError`.\n7.  The exception contains the `result` object with the history up to the point of failure, which is useful for debugging."
