- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse
- Activate Storage Locations
- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Locations
- Check the 'Specific Release Channel Restriction' box if you want to restrict movements
  to have the same release channel in pending output ones and the one that
  is trying to be moved in that location. That parameter will be applied
  to children locations.
- If you want to apply that restriction only on some specific locations,
  check the 'Specific Release Channel Restriction'. It won't be applied
  on children locations.
- If you want to take into account all pending incoming operations in that 
  location too, check the 'Release Channel Restriction For Incoming Moves' box too
  (that appears only if 'mixed' restriction is not selected above).
