When stock operators are putting products into Output location, it is better to
split those locations per group of deliveries. This can be extended to release
channels management as deliveries, in that case, are grouped per channel.

To help that process, we need to restrict output locations choice to those with
the same release channel as the ones that are waiting to be delivered.
