This module allows to restrict input movements to be validated to
locations that have pending output movements within another release
channel.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When stock operators are putting products into Output location, it is
better to split those locations per group of deliveries. This can be
extended to release channels management as deliveries, in that case, are
grouped per channel.

To help that process, we need to restrict output locations choice to
those with the same release channel as the ones that are waiting to be
delivered.

Configuration
=============

- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse
- Activate Storage Locations
- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Locations
- Check the 'Specific Release Channel Restriction' box if you want to
  restrict movements to have the same release channel in pending output
  ones and the one that is trying to be moved in that location. That
  parameter will be applied to children locations.
- If you want to apply that restriction only on some specific locations,
  check the 'Specific Release Channel Restriction'. It won't be applied
  on children locations.
- If you want to take into account all pending incoming operations in
  that location too, check the 'Release Channel Restriction For Incoming
  Moves' box too (that appears only if 'mixed' restriction is not
  selected above).
