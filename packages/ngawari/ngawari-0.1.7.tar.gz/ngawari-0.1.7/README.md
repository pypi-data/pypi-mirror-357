# Ngawari

Ngawari is a Python-based toolkit for simplifying operations in data analysis and processing, particularly focused on medical imaging and computational geometry. It is built heavily on top of the [VTK library](https://vtk.org/).

## Features

- Advanced geometric calculations and transformations
- Medical imaging data processing
- Statistical analysis tools
- 3D visualization capabilities

## Installation

To install Ngawari, run the following command:

```bash
pip install ngawari
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Ngawari:

```python
from ngawari import ftk

# Calculate Body Surface Area
height_cm = 170
weight_kg = 70
bsa = ftk.calculateBSA(height_cm, weight_kg)
print(f"Body Surface Area: {bsa:.2f} mÂ²")

# Fit a plane to 3D points
points = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]
plane = ftk.fitPlaneToPoints(points)
print(f"Fitted plane coefficients: {plane}")
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation.
