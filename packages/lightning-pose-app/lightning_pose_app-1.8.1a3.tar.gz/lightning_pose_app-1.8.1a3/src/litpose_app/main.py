All our methods are RPC style (http url corresponds to method name).
They should be POST requests, /rpc/<method_name>.
Request body is some object (pydantic model).
Response body is some object pydantic model.

The client expects all RPC methods to succeed. If any RPC doesn't
return the expected response object, it will be shown as an
error in a dialog to the user. So if the client is supposed to
handle the error in any way, for example, special form validation UX
like underlining the invalid field,
then the information about the error should be included in a valid
response object rather than raised as a python error.
