Realtime Algorithm Configuration Methods

This Software is a reimplementation of the realtime algorithm configurators (RAC) described in "ReACTR: Realtime Algorithm Configuration through Tournament Rankings", "Pool-Based Realtime Algorithm Configuration" and "Realtime gray-box algorithm configuration using cost-sensitive classification" into a collective RAC suite. It also includes extended options regarding logging, input, e.g. parameter space via PCS files, and target algorithm calls..
