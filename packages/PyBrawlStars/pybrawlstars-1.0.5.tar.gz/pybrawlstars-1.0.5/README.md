[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Brawl%20Stars%20API-v1-orange.svg)](https://developer.brawlstars.com)

An **asynchronous** Python API wrapper for the [Brawl Stars API](https://developer.brawlstars.com) that provides easy access to player statistics, club information, battle logs, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fully Asynchronous**: Built with `httpx` for high-performance async operations
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations for better IDE support and code reliability
- **Comprehensive Models**: Rich data models for all Brawl Stars entities
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling with custom error types
- **Auto Tag Parsing**: Automatic handling of Brawl Stars player/club tags
- **Session Management**: Efficient HTTP session management with connection pooling
- **Rate Limiting Ready**: Built to handle API rate limits gracefully
- **Easy Installation**: Available on PyPI for simple pip installation

## 📦 Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pybrawlstars
```

## 🔑 Getting Started

### 1. Get Your API Key

First, obtain your API key from the [Brawl Stars Developer Portal](https://developer.brawlstars.com).

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from pybrawlstars import BSClient

async def main():
    # Initialize the client with your API key
    client = BSClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    try:
        # Get player information
        player = await client.get_player("2PPQVUQ8J")
        print(f"Player: {player.name}")
        print(f"Trophies: {player.trophies}")
        
        # Get club information
        club = await client.get_club("2L90CG289")
        print(f"Club: {club.name}")
        print(f"Members: {len(club.members)}")
        
    finally:
        # Always close the client when done
        await client.close()

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### 3. Using Context Manager (Recommended)

```python
import asyncio
from pybrawlstars import BSClient

async def main():
    async with BSClient("YOUR_API_KEY") as client:
        player = await client.get_player("2PPQVUQ8J")
        print(f"Player: {player.name}")
        # Client automatically closes when exiting the context

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📚 API Reference

### BSClient

The main client class for interacting with the Brawl Stars API.

**Note**: Due to Brawl Stars API limitations, only the following 7 routes are supported:
- `get_player` - Get player profile
- `get_battlelog` - Get player battle log  
- `get_club` - Get club information
- `get_club_members` - Get club members
- `get_brawlers` - Get all brawlers
- `get_brawler` - Get specific brawler by ID
- `get_event_rotation` - Get current event rotation

#### Constructor

```python
BSClient(
    api_key: str,
    base_url: str = "https://api.brawlstars.com",
    version: int = 1,
    timeout: int = 10
)
```

#### Methods

##### Player Methods

```python
# Get player profile
await client.get_player(tag: str)

await client.get_battlelog(tag: str)
```

##### Club Methods

```python
# Get club information
await client.get_club(tag: str)

                for gadget in brawler.gadgets:
                    print(f"    - {gadget.name}")

asyncio.run(list_brawlers())
```

## 🏗️ Data Models

The library provides rich data models for all API responses:

- **Player**: Complete player profile with statistics and brawler progression
- **Club**: Club information including members and settings
- **Battle**: Individual battle results with participants and outcomes
- **Brawler**: Brawler information including star powers and gadgets
- **Event**: Current and upcoming game events
- **And many more!** Explore all available models in the library

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The library provides specific exception types for different error scenarios:

```python
import asyncio
from pybrawlstars import BSClient
from pybrawlstars.models.errors import APIError, NetworkError, ClientError

async def safe_api_call():
    async with BSClient("YOUR_API_KEY") as client:
        try:
            player = await client.get_player("INVALID_TAG")
        except APIError as e:
            print(f"API Error {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
        except NetworkError as e:
            print(f"Network Error: {e}")
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Invalid input: {e}")
        except TimeoutError as e:
            print(f"Request timed out: {e}")

asyncio.run(safe_api_call())
```

## 🏷️ Tag Formats

Player and club tags can be provided in multiple formats:
- With hashtag: `#2PPQVUQ8J`
- Without hashtag: `2PPQVUQ8J`

The library automatically handles tag parsing and URL encoding.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **httpx**: For async HTTP requests
- **typing-extensions**: For enhanced type hints (Python < 3.10)

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Use Context Managers**: Always use `async with BSClient()` for automatic resource cleanup
2. **Batch Requests**: Group related API calls together when possible
3. **Cache Results**: Consider caching frequently accessed data like brawler lists
4. **Handle Rate Limits**: The API has rate limits; implement appropriate delays if needed
5. **Reuse Client**: Create one client instance and reuse it for multiple requests
