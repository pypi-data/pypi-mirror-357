# 🚀 open-responses-server

A plug-and-play server that speaks OpenAI’s Responses API—no matter which AI backend you’re running.  

Ollama? vLLM? LiteLLM? Even OpenAI itself?  
This server bridges them all to the OpenAI ChatCompletions & Responses API interface.  

In plain words:  
👉 Want to run OpenAI’s Coding Assistant (Codex) or other OpenAI API clients against your own models?  
👉 Want to experiment with self-hosted LLMs but keep OpenAI’s API compatibility?  

This project makes it happen.  
It handles stateful chat, tool calls, and future features like file search & code interpreter—all behind a familiar OpenAI API.

# ✨ Why use this?

✅ Acts as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI’s Responses API.  
✅ Lets you run any backend AI (Ollama, vLLM, Groq, etc.) with OpenAI-compatible clients.  
✅ MCP support around both Chat Completions and Responses APIs
✅ Supports OpenAI’s new Coding Assistant / Codex that requires Responses API.  
✅ Built for innovators, researchers, OSS enthusiasts.  
✅ Enterprise-ready: scalable, reliable, and secure for production workloads.

# 🏗️ Quick Install

Latest release on PyPI:

```
pip install open-responses-server
```

Or install from source:

```
uv venv
uv pip install .
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"  # dev dependencies
```

Run the server:

```
# Using CLI tool (after installation)
otc start

# Or directly from source
uv run src/open_responses_server/cli.py start
```

Docker deployment:

```
# Run with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_BASE_URL_INTERNAL=http://your-llm-api:8000 \
  -e OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  ghcr.io/teabranch/open-responses-server:latest
```

Works great with docker-compose.yaml for Codex + your own model.

# 🛠️ Configure

Minimal config to connect your AI backend:

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL_INTERNAL=http://localhost:11434  # Ollama, vLLM, Groq, etc.
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080            # This server's endpoint
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-mockapikey123456789            # Mock key tunneled to backend
```

Server binding:
```
API_ADAPTER_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_ADAPTER_PORT=8080
```
Optional logging:
```
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE_PATH=./log/api_adapter.log
```

Configure with CLI tool:
```
# Interactive configuration setup
otc configure
```

Verify setup:
```
# Check if the server is working
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
```
