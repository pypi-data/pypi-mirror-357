    """Builds and saves the project manifest .feather file under the specified output directory.

    This function evaluates the input project directory and builds the 'manifest' file for the project. The file
    includes the descriptive information about every session stored inside the input project folder and the state of
    session's data processing (which processing pipelines have been applied to each session). The file will be created
    under the 'output_path' directory and use the following name pattern: {ProjectName}}_manifest.feather.

    Notes:
        The manifest file is primarily used to capture and move project state information between machines, typically
        in the context of working with data stored on a remote compute server or cluster. However, it can also be used
        on a local machine, since an up-to-date manifest file is required to run most data processing pipelines in the
        lab regardless of the runtime context.

    Args:
        raw_project_directory: The path to the root project directory used to store raw session data.
        output_directory: The path to the directory where to save the generated manifest file.
        processed_project_directory: The path to the root project directory used to store processed session data if it
            is different from the 'raw_project_directory'. Typically, this would be the case on remote compute server(s)
            and not on local machines.

    """Verifies the integrity of the session's raw data by generating the checksum of the raw_data directory and
    comparing it against the checksum stored in the ax_checksum.txt file.

    Primarily, this function is used to verify data integrity after transferring it from a local PC to the remote
    server for long-term storage. This function is designed to create the 'verified.bin' marker file if the checksum
    matches and to remove the 'telomere.bin' and 'verified.bin' marker files if it does not.

    Notes:
        Removing the telomere.bin marker file from session's raw_data folder marks the session as incomplete, excluding
        it from all further automatic processing.

        This function is also used to create the processed data hierarchy on the BioHPC server, when it is called as
        part of the data preprocessing runtime performed by a data acquisition system.

    Args:
        session_path: The path to the session directory to be verified. Note, the input session directory must contain
            the 'raw_data' subdirectory.
        create_processed_data_directory: Determines whether to create the processed data hierarchy during runtime.
        processed_data_root: The root directory where to store the processed data hierarchy. This path has to point to
            the root directory where to store the processed data from all projects, and it will be automatically
            modified to include the project name, the animal name, and the session ID.
