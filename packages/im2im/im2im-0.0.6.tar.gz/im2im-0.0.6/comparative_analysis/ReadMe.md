# Comparative Analysis 
We developed two VPLs for each task: one base VPL that directly integrates functions from multiple sources and the same VPL enhanced by our im2im library. The source code are available in the folders (1, 2).

**Note:** For detailed comparisons between visual programming systems (**visual interface and execution**) with and without `im2im`, refer to the following studies: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cf5M1gOMdMXaRIKsCYalVj99RzMYSy8C?usp=sharing), [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qPPL-IvovlhdKv-_0SjADBSOc60SPZDT?usp=sharing).
