class CenterType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration for different types of center coordination strategies.

    STRICT_PRIORITY:
        The center prioritizes its own goals by selecting plans
        that maximize its goal function (d_e^T * y_e),
        and then chooses among these the one most favorable to the element (by maximizing c_e^T * y_e).

    GUARANTEED_CONCESSION:
        The center allows for a controlled concession to the element
        by ensuring the element’s goal (c_e^T * y_e) reaches at least a given proportion
        of its optimal value ((1 - Δ_e) * f_opt_element).

    WEIGHTED_BALANCE:
        The center applies a weighted compromise strategy,
        balancing its own goal and the element’s objective using a positive weight coefficient (ω_e).
        This approach enables iterative adjustment toward a mutually acceptable solution.

    RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_COMPROMISE:
        The center solves a single, coupled optimization problem to allocate a global resource budget
        It aims to maximize its own overall goal (sum of d_e^T * y_e) while ensuring that
        each element meets a predefined target for its own goal like in "GUARANTEED_CONCESSION".
