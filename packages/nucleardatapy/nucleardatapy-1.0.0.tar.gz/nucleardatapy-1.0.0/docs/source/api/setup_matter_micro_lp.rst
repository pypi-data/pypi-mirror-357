Here are a set of figures which are produced with the Python sample: /nucleardatapy_sample/matter_setupMicroLP_plot.py

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/figs/plot_matter_setupMicro_LP0_SM.png
	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=0 Landau parameters in SM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/figs/plot_matter_setupMicro_LP1_SM.png
	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=1 Landau parameters in SM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/figs/plot_matter_setupMicro_LP0_NM.png
	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=0 Landau parameters in NM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.
