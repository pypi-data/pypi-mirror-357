Here are a set of figures which are produced with the Python sample: /nucleardatapy_sample/matter_setupMicro_plot.py

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/figs/plot_matter_setupMicro_e2a_NM_VAR.png
	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the energy in neutron matter (NM) over the free Fermi gas energy (top) and the energy per particle (bottom) as function of the density (left) and the neutron Fermi momentum (right) for the variational models available in the nucleardatapy toolkit.
