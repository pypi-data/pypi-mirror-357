Here are a set of figures which are produced with the Python sample: /nucleardatapy_sample/matter_setupFFGNuc_plot.py

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/figs/plot_matter_setupFFGNuc_EP.png
	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the free Fermi gas energy (top) and pressure (bottom) in symmetric matter (SM) (Blue solid line) and neutron matter (NM) (orange dashed line) as function of the particle density (left) and Fermi momentum (right).

	:width: 70%
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the free Fermi gas equation of state in
	symmetric matter (SM) (Blue solid line) and neutron matter
	(NM) (orange dashed line) as function of the energy density
	(with rest mass contribution).
