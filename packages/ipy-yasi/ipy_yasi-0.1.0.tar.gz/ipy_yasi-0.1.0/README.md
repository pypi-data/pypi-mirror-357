## How to use

You can try it online with Binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jack-Byte/yasi/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2F%2Fexamples%2Fmoney_and_kangaroos.ipynb)

Import JupyterChat, set openai_base_url (only if you are not using
Openai itself), and provide your api key directly or as the env variable
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

``` python
from yasi.core import JupyterChat

jc = JupyterChat(openai_base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1", api_key=None)
```

### Query Openai directly

You can use the `send_query` method to interacte through a code cell
directly. The response will be added as a new markdown cell in your
current notebook.

``` python
jc.send_query('Kia ora, how are you?')
```

Kia ora! I’m doing well, thanks for asking! It’s great to connect with
you and practice some basic Maori phrases. How can I help you today?

### Send Dialoge from your Notebook

JupyterChat is designed to extract messages from your current notebook
and construct a dialoge.

It’s searching for markdown cells that contain the tags

- `#| chat_system` (optional) sets the context for the conversation,
  providing the AI with a “hint” about the type of response expected
- `#| chat_user` your messages
- `#| chat_assistant` the AIs real responses, or the ones that you
  ingest into the dialog

and sends the dialog to the Openai API.
