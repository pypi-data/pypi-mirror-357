        Please describe what is said in the following one or two paragraphs, as a 
        summary or caption for the content. Rules:

        - Mention only the most important points. Include all the key topics discussed.
        
        - Keep the caption short! Use ONE sentence or TWO SHORT sentences, with a total of 10-15
          words. It must be significantly shorter than the input text.
        
        - Write in clean and and direct language.

        - Do not mention the text or the author. Simply state the points as presented.

        - If the content contains other promotional material or only references information such as
            about what will be discussed later, ignore it.

        - DO NOT INCLUDE any other commentary.

        - If the input is very short or so unclear you can't summarize it, simply output
            "(No results)".

        - If the input is in a language other than English, output the caption in the same language.

        Sample input text:

        I think push ups are one of the most underrated exercises out there and they're also one of
        the exercises that is most frequently performed with poor technique.
        And I think this is because a lot of people think it's just an easy exercise and they adopt
        a form that allows them to achieve a rep count that they would expect from an easy exercise,
        but all that ends up happening is they they do a bunch of poor quality repetitions in order
        to get a high rep count. So I don't think push ups are particularly easy when they're done well
        and they're really effective for building just general fitness and muscle in the upper body
        if you do them properly. So here's how you get the most out of them.

        Sample output text:

        Push ups are an underrated exercise. They are not easy to do well.
