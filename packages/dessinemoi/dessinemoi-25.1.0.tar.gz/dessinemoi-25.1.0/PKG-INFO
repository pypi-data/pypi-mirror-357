# Dessine-moi, a simple Python factory

> S'il vous plaît, dessine-moi un mouton.

The narrator of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's Little Prince probably dreamt of a
factory like this one...

## Motivation

*Dessine-moi* is a simple Python implementation of the factory pattern. It was
born from the need to create dynamically object trees from nested dictionaries
(*e.g.* a JSON document).

## Features

- Create a `Factory` object and register types to it
- Use dictionaries to create objects from the factory
- Create *attrs*-compatible converters to automatically convert dictionaries to
  instances of registered types
- Customize factories to your needs

Check the [documentation](https://dessinemoi.readthedocs.io) for more detail.
