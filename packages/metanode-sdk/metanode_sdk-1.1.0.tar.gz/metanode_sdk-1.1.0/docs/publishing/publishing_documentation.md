# MetaNode SDK: Complete Documentation for Publishing

## Overview

The MetaNode SDK provides a complete blockchain-grade infrastructure for secure, lightweight, and highly scalable federated computing and dApp deployment. This documentation covers the essential features and components for successful publication to GitHub, PyPI, and npm.

## Key Features to Highlight

### 1. Blockchain Integration

The SDK includes comprehensive blockchain modules:
- **validator.py**: Agreement validation, consensus verification, and runtime proof management
- **transaction.py**: Transaction creation, signing, submission, and status checking
- **infrastructure.py**: Kubernetes setup and multi-layer infrastructure automation
- **chainlink.lock**: Cryptographic proofs linking agreements and execution to the blockchain

### 2. Docker vPod Container Technology

Our innovative vPod container approach:
- Solves previous UI dependency issues by enabling fully console-based workflows
- Creates immutable execution environments with docker.lock verification
- Provides consistent runtime across development and production
- Ensures tamper-proof execution with cryptographic integrity checks

### 3. Testnet Integration

The testnet component at `http://159.203.17.36:8545` provides:
- Decentralized verification layer for all executions
- Connection testing and monitoring
- Verification proof generation
- Node cluster creation for enhanced network decentralization

### 4. CLI Enhancements

The enhanced CLI structure includes:
- **metanode-cli-main**: Central entry point for all SDK operations
- **metanode-cli-agreement**: Agreement creation and management
- **metanode-cli-testnet**: Testnet connection and verification
- **metanode-deploy**: Automatic dApp deployment

### 5. Kubernetes Integration

The SDK leverages Kubernetes for:
- Scalable node cluster deployment
- Multi-role node management (validator, light client, sync)
- Decentralized infrastructure with peer connections
- Agreement execution in isolated environments

## Package Structure

Both the PyPI and npm packages include:

- **Python SDK Core**: The foundation of the MetaNode architecture
- **JavaScript Wrappers**: For npm integration with Node.js applications
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for all operations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides, tutorials, and API references
- **Example Applications**: Demonstration code for common use cases

## Verification Architecture

Our verification architecture ensures:

1. **Immutability**: Applications cannot be tampered with after deployment
2. **Decentralization**: Multiple independent nodes verify execution
3. **Trustless Verification**: Cryptographic proofs anchored to blockchain
4. **Data Sovereignty**: Developers maintain control over execution environments

## Installation Methods

The SDK can be installed via:

### PyPI (Python Package Index)
```bash
pip install metanode-sdk
```

### npm (Node Package Manager)
```bash
npm install metanode-sdk
```

### GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/metanode-sdk.git
cd metanode-sdk
pip install -e .
```

## Key Use Cases

1. **Transform Applications to dApps**:
   ```python
   from metanode.dapp import make_dapp
   result = make_dapp("/path/to/app", use_mainnet=False)
   ```

2. **Create Blockchain Agreements**:
   ```bash
   metanode-cli agreement my-app --create
   ```

3. **Connect to Testnet**:
   ```bash
   metanode-cli testnet my-app --setup
   metanode-cli testnet my-app --create-cluster
   ```

4. **Verify Execution**:
   ```bash
   metanode-cli testnet my-app --setup-proofs
   ```
