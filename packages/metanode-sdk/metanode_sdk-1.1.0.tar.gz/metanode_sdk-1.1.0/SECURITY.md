# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MetaNode SDK team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [your-security-email@example.com](mailto:your-security-email@example.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested mitigation or remediation steps (if any)
- Any proof-of-concept or exploit code (if applicable)

### Security Update Process

When we receive a security vulnerability report:

1. We will confirm receipt of the vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. The security team will analyze and validate the vulnerability.
3. We will determine the impact and criticality of the vulnerability.
4. We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.
5. We will release a security update as soon as possible, depending on complexity and severity.
6. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix has been applied, giving proper credit to the reporter.
