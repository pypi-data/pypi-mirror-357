"""
Defines CLI commands for reconstructing split files and downloading
files or folders using 'gclone' with resumable, multi-transfer support.

Commands:

- rebuild(path): Reassemble a split file set into the original file.
- download(id, dest, transfers): Copy from sadrive remote by ID to local path.

    Rebuilds a file split into ".sapart" parts based on a manifest.

    Args:
        path: Filesystem path to the ".sapart" directory containing part files

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If any expected part file is missing during rebuild.
    Side Effects:
        - Reads the manifest to obtain original filename and part order.
        - Concatenates each part into the rebuilt file in the parent directory.
        - Removes the original ".sapart" directory upon success.
