"""
sadrive CLI Entrypoint

Main command-line interface for the SA-Drive application, managing cloud storage
uploads, downloads, navigation, and service account configuration using Google Drive.

Commands are modularly registered from submodules and grouped into the `sadrive` command.

Behavior:
    - On every invocation (except `config set-dir`), validates that a config directory
      has been set and initializes the rclone config if missing.
    - Delegates to subcommands such as upload, navigate, search, delete, share, etc.

Subcommands:
    - config: Configure SA-Drive environment (set or show config path)
    - update_sas: Synchronize service account usage with DB
    - upload: Upload a file or directory to SA-Drive
    - navigate: Browse remote Drive structure
    - mount: Mount SA-Drive using gclone
    - delete: Delete a specific file or folder from Drive and DB
    - clearall: Wipe all Drive contents across accounts
    - newfolder: Create a folder in SA-Drive
    - download: Download a file or folder using gclone
    - rebuild: Reconstruct a .sapart split file
    - share: Share a file/folder via link
    - rename: Rename a file/folder on Drive
    - open-link: Open a file/folder in browser
    - search: Fuzzy or strict search for files
    - details: Show storage usage by each service account

Usage:
    sadrive <subcommand> [options]

Example:
    sadrive upload ~/Videos/movie.mp4
