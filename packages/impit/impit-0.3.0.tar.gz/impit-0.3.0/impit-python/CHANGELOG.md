# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## py-0.2.3 - 2025-05-09

#### Features

- Add context manager interface for `Client` and `AsyncClient` (#176)
  - Enables using `AsyncClient` and `Client` constructors as context managers inside the `with statements`. Closes #174



## py-0.2.2 - 2025-05-07

#### Bug Fixes

- Reenable HTTP/3 features in JS bindings (#57)
  - Recent package updates might have broken the `http3` feature in Node.JS bindings. This PR solves the underlying problems by building the reqwest's `Client` from within the `napi-rs`-managed `tokio` runtime.  Adds tests for `http3` usage from Node bindings.  Removes problematic Firefox header (`Connection` is not allowed in HTTP2 and HTTP3 requests or responses and together with `forceHttp3` was causing panics inside the Rust code).


- `response.encoding` contains the actual encoding (#119)
  - Parses the `content-type` header for the `charset` parameter.


- Case-insensitive request header deduplication (#127)
  - Refactors and simplifies the custom header logic. Custom headers now override "impersonated" browser headers regardless on the (upper|lower)case.


#### Features

- Add `ReadableStream` in `Response.body` (#28)
  - Accessing `Response.body` now returns an instance of JS `ReadableStream`. This API design matches the (browser) Fetch API spec. In order to correctly manage the `Response` consumption, the current codebase has been slightly refactored.  Note that the implementation relies on a prerelease version of the `napi-rs` tooling.


- Add Python bindings for `impit` (#49)
  - Adds Python bindings for `impit`. The interface is inspired by the `httpx` library (in the same way the JS bindings' interface is inspired by `fetch`, i.e. the end goal is to provide an almost drop-in replacement with extra features).


- Use `thiserror` for better error handling DX (#90)
  - Adds `std::error::Error` implementation with `thiserror`. This should improve the developer experience and error messages across the monorepo.


- Allow passing binary body to the `data` parameter (#103)
  - Following the discussion under #97 , this PR widens the type accepted by the `data` parameter.  `data` now accepts both a `dict[str,str]` and a binary representation of the request body. This PR intentionally doesn't update the recently added typings in the `impit.pyi` file, as this behaviour (accepting the binary body) is considered deprecated in the `httpx` library we use as the design master.


- Make `ImpitPyResponse` public for Python with the name `Response` (#110)
  - - Make `ImpitPyResponse` public for Python with the name `Response`. This will improve type handling and code navigation in the IDE  ---------


- Add `url` and `content` property for `Response`, smart `.text` decoding, options for redirects  (#122)
  - Adds `url`, `encoding` and `content` properties for `Response`. Decodes the response using the automatic encoding-determining algorithm. Adds redirect-related options.  ---------


- `response.headers` is a `Headers` object (#137)
  - Turns the `response.headers` from a `Record<string, string>` into a `Headers` object, matching the original `fetch` API.


- Better errors (#150)
  - Improves the error handling in `impit` and both the language bindings. Improves error messages.  For Python bindings, this PR adds the same exception types as in `httpx`.


- Switch to `Vec<(String, String)>` for request headers (#156)
  - Allows sending multiple request headers of the same name across all bindings / tools.  Broadens the `RequestInit.headers` type in the `impit-node` bindings. Closes #151



## 0.1.5 - 2025-01-23

#### Bug Fixes

- Use replacement character on invalid decode (#25)
  - When decoding incorrectly encoded content, the binding now panics and takes down the entire JS script. This change replaces the incorrect sequence with the U+FFFD replacement character (ï¿½) in the content. This is most often the desired behaviour.
