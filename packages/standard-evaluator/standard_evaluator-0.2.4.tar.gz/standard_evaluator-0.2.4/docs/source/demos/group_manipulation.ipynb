    "In this notebook engineer 2 is editing the assembly to remove the `characteristic_lenghts` component from it. This is done by editing the JSON file and creating a new JSON file that only has the definitions of the components needed to do the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also re-order the components to move the `nacelles` and `canard` component to the top of the assembly to demonstrate how easy it is to change the order of the components in the assembly.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> In this example the manipulation of the Python dictionary that was created from the JSON file is very manual and not automated. This was just done to demonstrate the ability to edit the JSON directly. Automation in Python or any other language can be developed to make this easier and less error prone.\n",
