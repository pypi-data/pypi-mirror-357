# Update mypy pre-commit hook

This script uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to update the `additional_dependencies` of the
[mypy pre-commit hook](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy).

> **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**
>
> This will rewrite your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and you will **lose all comments**.

With `uv export` it will generate a list of _all_ dependencies required to run mypy.
By default, it assumes that an `uv` dependency group, called *mypy*, exists and contains all additional dependencies
(besides the project dependencies) to successfully run type checking.
The group(s) may only contain the direct dependencies. Transitive dependencies are derived by `uv` automatically.

The dependency group(s) can be overwritten by `-g/--group` option.

## Installation

If you have installed `uv` on your machine or is already part of your dependencies you can run
```shell
pip install update-mypy-hook
```
or with uv
```shell
uv add update-mypy-hook --group dev
```

If `uv` is not part of your setup, use the extra
```shell
pip install update-mypy-hook[uv]
```

## Using update-mypy-hook

Run in your python project root folder
```shell
update-mypy-hook --help
```

## Pre-commit hook
Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/H4rryK4ne/update-mypy-hook
  rev: 0.1.0
  hooks:
  - id: update-dependency-mypy-hook
    additional_dependencies:
    - uv # if uv is not installed on every developer's system

    - --extra-excluded-package=some_other_package
```
