# Polta
_Data engineering tool combining Polars transformations with Delta tables/lakes._

![PyTest](https://github.com/JoshTG/polta/actions/workflows/run-pytest.yml/badge.svg) [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/polta.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/polta/)

# Core Concepts
The `polta` module revolves around the following core objects that, in conjunction with each other, allow you to create small-to-medium-scale pipelines.

Throughout this README and in the repository's `sample` pipelines, various objects are aliased in a consistent manner when imported. Below is a table of such aliases for convenience.

## At a Glance

* A `Metastore` manages data in a uniform and consistent manner for `Pipelines`.
* A `Pipeline` connects `Pipes` together into a uniform execution plan.
* Each `Pipe` takes data from one location, transforms it, and saves it into another location. It does so in one of three ways:
  * By ingesting source data via a `Ingester`.
  * By transforming data across layers via a `Transformer`.
  * By exporting the data in a desired format via a `Exporter`.
* The data are managed in `Tables`, which use `deltalake` and `polars` under the hood.

## Terminology

| Object        | Alias                               | Example            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------  | ------------------ |
| `Table`       | tab_<quality-prefix\>_<table-name\> | tab_raw_activity   |
| `Exporter`    | exp_<quality-prefix\>_<table-name\> | exp_can_user       | 
| `Ingester`    | ing_<quality-prefix\>_<table-name\> | ing_raw_activity   |
| `Transformer` | tra_<quality-prefix\>_<table-name\> | tra_con_user       |
| `Pipe`        | pip_<quality-prefix\>_<table-name\> | pip_con_activity   |
| `Pipeline`    | ppl_<domain\>_<table-name\>         | ppl_standard_user  |

To illustrate, a `Table` is initially declared like this:

```python
# raw_table.py
from polta.enums import TableQuality
from polta.table import Table


table: Table = Table(
  domain='standard',
  quality=TableQuality.RAW,
  name='test'
)
```

And another like this:

```python
# conformed_table.py
from polta.enums import TableQuality
from polta.table import Table


table: Table = Table(
  domain='standard',
  quality=TableQuality.CONFORMED,
  name='test'
)
```

Then, whenever they are imported from another file, they are aliased like this:
```python
# other-file.py
from .raw_table import table as tab_raw_test
from .conformed_table import table as tab_con_test

...
```

The naming conventions are designed this way for the following reasons:
1. It keeps initial declarations simple.
2. It allows importing multiple objects (e.g., `Table` and `Pipe` objects) while avoiding variable collisions.
3. It adds consistent and descriptive identifiers to the objects throughout the codebase.

> Feel free to name and organize your objects however you wish in your own repository. However, make sure you understand how this repository works to make the most sense out of the documentation and samples.

## Metastore

Every `polta` integration should have a dedicated metastore for preserving data and logs. This is automatically created and managed by `polta` before executing any reads or writes.

There are two main aspects of a `Metastore`:

1. *Tables*: Contains every table across all layers.
2. *Volumes*: Contains file storage systems needed for transformations.

This structure is inspired by `deltalake` and follows similar metastore paradigms. It loosely follows the modern [Medallion Architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) language for organizing the data layers, with these naming conventions for each layer:

1. *Raw*: Source data, usually a payload string.
2. *Conformed*: Structured data.
3. *Canonical*: Business-level data.
4. *Export*: Cleaned, formatted export data.

If the data can be conformed easily, it may get loaded from the ingestion zone into _conformed_. Otherwise, it should get loaded into _raw_.

## Table

The `Table` is the primary way to read and write data.

It stores data using `deltalake`, and it transforms data using `polars`. Because it integrates two modules together, it has many fields and methods for communicating seamlessly to and fro. For example, every `Table` has readily available a `schema_polars` and `schema_deltalake` object that both represent your table schema.

Each raw `Table` has a dedicated ingestion zone located in the `Metastore` to store sources files ready to be loaded into the raw layer.

> In this repository, a `Table` alias is formatted as `tab_<quality-abbreviation>_<table-name>` (e.g., `tab_con_user`).

## Pipe

The `Pipe` is the primary way to transform data from one location to another in a new format.

Currently, there are three kinds of supported pipes, each described below.

> In this repository, a `Pipe` alias is formatted as `pip_<quality-abbreviation>_<target-table-name>` (e.g., `pip_con_user`).

### Ingester

The `Ingester` is the primary way to load source files into the raw layer.

It currently supports ingesting these formats:

1. JSON
2. String payload

An instance can get passed into a `Pipe` to ingest data into a `Table`.

### Transformer

The `Transformer` reads one or more `Table` objects from a layer, applies transformation logic, and writes the output into a target `Table`.

### Exporter

The `Exporter` reads a `Table` and exports it in a desired format usually into an export directory within the `Metastore`.

It currently supports exporting these formats:
1. JSON
2. CSV

## Pipeline

The `Pipeline` is the primary way to link `Pipe` objects together to create a unified data pipeline.

It takes in a list of raw, conformed, canonical, and export `Pipe` objects and executes them sequentially.

There are two kinds of pipelines you can build:

1. `Standard`: each step in the pipeline saves to `Table` objects in the metastore. During execution, pipes typically retrieve the current state of each of those `Table` objects and saves the output in the target `Table`. This allows a full end-to-end-pipeline that preserves all pipe outputs into the metastore for future usage.
2. `In Memory`: each step in the pipeline preserves the `DataFrames` across layers and loads them into each subsequent pipe. This allows a full end-to-end pipeline that can export the results without reling on preserving the intermediate data in the metastore. 

If you need to store each run over time, you should use a `Standard` pipeline. However, if you simply want to load a dataset, transform it, and export it into a format, just wanting to preserve that export, then you should use an `In Memory` pipeline. The `sample` directory contains pipelines for both kinds.

# Installation

## Installing to a Project
This project exists in `PyPI` and can be installed this way:

```sh
pip install polta
```

## Initializing the Repository

To use the code from the repository itself, either for testing or contributing, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment, preferably using `venv`, that runs `Python 3.13`. 
3. Ensure you have `poetry` installed (installation instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)).
4. Make `poetry` use the virtual environment using `poetry env use .venv/path/to/python`.
5. Download dependencies by executing `poetry install`.
6. Building a wheel file by executing `poetry build`.

# Testing

This project uses `pytest` for its tests, all of which exist in the `tests` directory. Below are recommended testing options.

## Run Tests via VS Code

There is a `Testing` tab in the left-most menu by default that allows you to run `pytest` tests in bulk or individually.

## Run Tests via Poetry
To execute tests using `poetry`, run this command in your terminal at the top-level directory:

```sh
poetry run pytest tests/ -vv -s
```

##  Check Test Coverage

To check the overall test coverage, use the `pytest-cov` package by running this command in your terminal at the top-level directory:

```sh
poetry run pytest --cov=polta tests/ -vv -s
```

If you do not have 100% coverage, you can see which lines of code are not covered by running this command:

```sh
poetry run coverage report -m
```

# Usage

Below are sample code snippets to show basic usage. For full sample pipelines, consult the `sample` directory in the repository. These tables, pipes, and pipeline get used in the integration test which is located in the `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` pytest file.

Below is a diagram of the basic pipeline architecture with these features:

- The columns represent logical layers where data is stored.
- The rows represent the two kinds of data within the metastore.
- The pipes represent `Pipe` objects.
- The rectangles represent `Table` objects.
- The rectangles with wavy bottom sides represent directories in the metastore with various files.

## Sample Metastore

The creation of a new metastore is simple. Below is a sample metastore that can be passed into the initialization of any `Table` to ensure the table writes to the metastore.

```python
from polta.metastore import Metastore


metastore: Metastore = Metastore('path/to/desired/store')
```

## Sample Ingester Pipe

This sample code illustrates a simple raw ingestion pipe.

A pipe file typically contains a `Table` and a `Pipe`, and a raw table might have an additional `Ingester`.

```python
from deltalake import Field, Schema

from polta.enums import (
  DirectoryType,
  RawFileType,
  TableQuality
)
from polta.ingester import Ingester
from polta.pipe import Pipe
from polta.table import Table

from .metastore import metastore


table: Table = Table(
  domain='sample',
  quality=TableQuality.RAW,
  name='table',
  raw_schema=Schema([
    Field('payload', 'string')
  ]),
  metastore=metastore
)

ingester: Ingester = Ingester(
  table=table,
  directory_type=DirectoryType.SHALLOW,
  raw_file_type=RawFileType.JSON
)

pipe: Pipe = Pipe(ingester)
```

By making `table.raw_schema` a simple payload, that signals to the ingester that the transformation is a simple file read.

This code is all that is needed to execute a load of all data from the ingestion zone to a raw table. To do so, execute `pipe.execute()`.

If you want to read the data, execute `table.get()`.

## Sample Transformer Pipe

For instances where transformation logic is required, you should use the `Transformer` class to transform data from one layer to another.

```python
from deltalake import Field, Schema
from polars import col, DataFrame
from polars.datatypes import DataType, List, Struct

from polta.enums import TableQuality, WriteLogic
from polta.maps import Maps
from polta.pipe import Pipe
from polta.table import Table
from polta.transformer import Transformer
from polta.udfs import string_to_struct
from sample.standard.table import \
  table as tab_raw_table

from .metastore import metastore


table: Table = Table(
  domain='test',
  quality=TableQuality.CONFORMED,
  name='table',
  raw_schema=Schema([
    Field('id', 'string'),
    Field('active_ind', 'boolean')
  ]),
  metastore=metastore
)

def get_dfs() -> dict[str, DataFrame]:
  """Basic load logic:
    1. Get raw table data as a DataFrame
    2. Anti join against conformed layer to get net-new records
  
  Returns:
    dfs (dict[str, DataFrame]): The resulting data as 'table'
  """
  conformed_ids: DataFrame = table.get(select=['_raw_id'], unique=True)
  df: DataFrame = (tab_raw_table
    .get()
    .join(conformed_ids, '_raw_id', 'anti')
  )
  return {'table': df}

def transform(dfs: dict[str, DataFrame]) -> DataFrame:
  """Basic transformation logic:
    1. Retrieve the raw table DataFrame
    2. Convert 'payload' into a struct
    3. Explode the struct
    4. Convert the struct key-value pairs into column-cell values

  Returns:
    df (DataFrame): the resulting DataFrame
  """
  df: DataFrame = dfs['table']
  raw_polars_schema: dict[str, DataType] = Maps \
      .deltalake_schema_to_polars_schema(table.raw_schema)

  return (df
    .with_columns([
      col('payload')
        .map_elements(string_to_struct, return_dtype=List(Struct(raw_polars_schema)))
    ])
    .explode('payload')
    .with_columns([
      col('payload').struct.field(f).alias(f)
      for f in [n.name for n in table.raw_schema.fields]
    ])
    .drop('payload')
  )

transformer: Transformer = Transformer(
  table=table,
  load_logic=get_dfs,
  transform_logic=transform,
  write_logic=WriteLogic.APPEND
)

pipe: Pipe = Pipe(transformer)
```

This `Transformer` instance receives the raw data from the previous example, explodes the data, and extracts the proper fields into a proper conformed DataFrame.

This one file contains every object in a modular format, which means you can import in another file any part of the pipe as needed.

> This modular design also allows you to create integration and unit tests around your `load_logic` and `transform_logic` easily, as illustrated in the `tests/` directory.

You can execute the `Pipe` by running `pipe.execute()` wherever you want, and any new raw files will get transformed and loaded into the conformed layer.

## Sample Pipeline

To connect the above pipes together, you can create a `Pipeline`, as sampled below.

```python
from polta.pipeline import Pipeline

from sample.standard.raw.table import \
  pipe as pip_raw_sample
from sample.standard.conformed.table import \
  pipe as pip_con_sample


pipeline: Pipeline = Pipeline(
  raw_pipes=[pip_raw_sample],
  conformed_pipes=[pip_con_sample]
)
```

You can then execute your pipeline by running `pipeline.execute()`.
