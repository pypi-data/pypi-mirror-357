        This object combines Cleanlab's TrustworthyRAG evaluation scores with configurable thresholds to detect potentially bad responses
        in your RAG application. When a bad response is detected, Cleanlab automatically attempts to remediate by retrieving an expert-provided
        answer from the Codex Project you've integrated with your RAG app. If no expert answer is available,
        the corresponding query is logged in the Codex Project for SMEs to answer.

        For production, use the `validate()` method which provides a complete validation workflow including both detection and remediation.

        Args:
            codex_access_key (str): The [access key](/codex/web_tutorials/create_project/#access-keys) for a Codex project. Used to retrieve expert-provided answers
                when bad responses are detected, or otherwise log the corresponding queries for SMEs to answer.

            eval_thresholds (dict[str, float], optional): Custom thresholds (between 0 and 1) for specific evals.
                Keys should either correspond to an Eval from [TrustworthyRAG](/tlm/api/python/utils.rag/#class-trustworthyrag)
                or a custom eval for your project. If not provided, project settings will be used.


        Raises:
            TypeError: If any threshold value is not a number.
            ValueError: If any threshold value is not between 0 and 1.

            context (str): The context that was retrieved from the RAG Knowledge Base and used to generate the response.
            response (str): A reponse from your LLM/RAG system.
            prompt (str, optional): Optional prompt representing the actual inputs (combining query, context, and system instructions into one string) to the LLM that generated the response.
            form_prompt (Callable[[str, str], str], optional): Optional function to format the prompt based on query and context. Cannot be provided together with prompt, provide one or the other. This function should take query and context as parameters and return a formatted prompt string. If not provided, a default prompt formatter will be used. To include a system prompt or any other special instructions for your LLM, incorporate them directly in your custom form_prompt() function definition.
            metadata (dict, optional): Additional custom metadata to associate with the query logged in the Codex Project.
            eval_scores (dict[str, float], optional): Scores assessing different aspects of the RAG system. If provided, TLM Trustworthy RAG will not be used to generate scores.

        Returns:
            ProjectValidateResponse: A response object containing:
                - eval_scores (Dict[str, EvalScores]): Evaluation scores for the original response along with a boolean flag, `failed`,
                  indicating whether the score is below the threshold.
                - expert_answer (Optional[str]): Alternate SME-provided answer from Codex if the response was flagged as bad and
                  an answer was found in the Codex Project, or None otherwise.
                - is_bad_response (bool): True if the response is flagged as potentially bad and triggered escalation to SMEs.
