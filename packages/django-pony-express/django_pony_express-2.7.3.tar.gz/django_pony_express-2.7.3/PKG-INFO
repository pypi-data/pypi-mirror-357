Welcome to the **django-pony-express** - class-based emails for Django shipping with a full test
suite.

Similar to class-based view in Django core, this package provides a neat, DRY and testable (!) way to handle your
emails in Django.

* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-pony-express/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ambient-innovation/django-pony-express)
* [Full documentation](https://django-pony-express.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* Creator & Maintainer: [Ambient Digital](https://ambient.digital/)


## Features

* Class-based structure for emails
   * Avoid duplicate low-level setup
   * Utilise inheritance and OOP benefits
   * No duplicated templates for HTML and plain-text
* Test suite to write proper unit-tests for your emails
   * Access your test outbox like a Django queryset

## Etymology

> The Pony Express was an American express mail service that used relays of horse-mounted riders. [...] During its
> 18 months of operation, the Pony Express reduced the time for messages to travel between the east and west US
> coast to about 10 days.
>
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express

The name of this package combines the Django mascot (a pony) with a once quite successful mail service in the US.
Ingenious, right?

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install django-pony-express`

  or via pipenv:

  `pipenv install django-pony-express`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        "django_pony_express",
    )
    ```
