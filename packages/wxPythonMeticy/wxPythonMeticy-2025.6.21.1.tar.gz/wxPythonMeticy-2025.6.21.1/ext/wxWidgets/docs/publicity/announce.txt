March 20, 2025 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.7 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.7

This release contains more than a hundred bug fixes and improvements. Some of
the most important fixes are:

- Build fixes for gcc 14 (#24248, #24869) and clang 19 (#24922, #24959, #25064).
- Fix build with macOS 15 SDK (#24724, #24879).
- Many fixes to key event generation in wxGTK (#25053, #25199, #25200).
- Avoid repaint problems when using wxWindow::Update() with Wayland (#25036).

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, meaning that
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!
