# Progress: `pape-mcp-server-time`

## 1. What Works

- The Memory Bank has been initialized with the core documentation files (`projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
- A clear plan has been established for the initial phase of the project.
- The `src/time` directory has been successfully downloaded from the GitHub repository.
- The `pyproject.toml` file has been updated with the new package name `pape-mcp-server-time` and the script entry point.
- The `mcp_server_time` directory has been renamed to `pape_mcp_server_time`.
- The `ZoneInfoNotFoundError: 'No time zone found with key PDT'` error has been successfully reproduced by running `uv run pape-mcp-server-time`.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Publish the forked package (Optional):** If requested by the user, publish the fixed package to PyPI.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Error Resolution and Verification
- **Status:** Error resolved and verified.
- **Next Step:** Await user instruction for optional publishing to PyPI.

## 4. Known Issues

- The `ZoneInfoNotFoundError: 'No time zone found with key PDT'` has been resolved.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision:** The project began with a clear goal to fork and fix the `mcp-server-time` package.
- **Documentation First:** The first action was to initialize the Memory Bank to ensure a well-documented and maintainable workflow.
- **Download Method:** Switched from `svn export` to `git clone` followed by `mv` and `rm -rf` due to `svn` not being found. This successfully downloaded the required directory.
- **Error Resolution Confirmed:** The error has been successfully resolved and verified.
- **Dependency Added:** `tzlocal` has been added as a dependency to correctly determine the local timezone.
- **Import Paths Updated:** Internal import paths have been updated to reflect the new package name.
