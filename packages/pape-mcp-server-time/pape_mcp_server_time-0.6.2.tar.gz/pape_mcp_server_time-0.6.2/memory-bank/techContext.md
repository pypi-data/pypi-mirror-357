# Tech Context: `pape-mcp-server-time`

## 1. Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the server. The original package requires Python >= 3.10.
- **`uv`:** The primary tool for running and managing the Python environment. It will be used to run the server locally (`uv run`).
- **`pip`:** An alternative package manager for Python.
- **`svn`:** A version control system used in this case to download a specific directory from a Git repository.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** The protocol the server implements to communicate with AI clients.

## 2. Development Setup

- The project will be set up in the current working directory.
- No special IDE or editor is required, but the user is interacting through a VS Code-like environment.
- The primary dependency management and execution will be handled by `uv`.

## 3. Technical Constraints

- We must work within the existing structure of the `mcp-server-time` package.
- The solution should not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary to fix the error.
- The final package must be compatible with the user's environment, which uses `uvx` for running MCP servers.

## 4. Tool Usage Patterns

- **`svn export`:** To download the source code. The URL will be `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/trunk/src/time`. The `trunk` path is used to specify the `main` branch.
- **`read_file` and `replace_in_file`:** To modify the `pyproject.toml` and other necessary files.
- **`execute_command`:** To run the server using `uv run pape_mcp_server_time` and reproduce the error.
