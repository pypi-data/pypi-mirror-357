# Active Context: Error Diagnosis

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on verifying the successful resolution of the `ZoneInfoNotFoundError` and preparing for potential PyPI publication.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Diagnosed the `ZoneInfoNotFoundError` as an issue with resolving abbreviated timezones (e.g., "PDT") to IANA timezone names.
- Added `tzlocal` as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` to correctly determine the local IANA timezone.
- Modified `pape-mcp-server-time/src/pape_mcp_server_time/server.py` to use `tzlocal.get_localzone()` for local timezone determination.
- Updated import paths in `pape-mcp-server-time/src/pape_mcp_server_time/__main__.py` and `pape-mcp-server-time/test/time_server_test.py` to reflect the new package name.
- Successfully ran the server, confirming the `ZoneInfoNotFoundError` is resolved.

## 3. Next Steps

- Await user instruction for optional publishing of the `pape-mcp-server-time` package to PyPI.

## 4. Key Decisions & Considerations

- **Solution:** The `tzlocal` library provides a robust solution for obtaining the IANA timezone name, which is crucial for `zoneinfo` to function correctly.
- **Verification:** Running the server locally confirmed the fix. Further testing (e.g., running the test suite) could be performed if requested.
- **Publishing:** The package is now ready for publishing to PyPI if the user desires. This would involve building the package and using `twine` to upload it.
