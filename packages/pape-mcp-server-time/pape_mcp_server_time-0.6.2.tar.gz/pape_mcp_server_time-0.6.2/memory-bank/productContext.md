# Product Context: `pape-mcp-server-time`

## 1. Problem Space

The user is experiencing an error with the `mcp-server-time` PyPI package when running it with `uvx`. This prevents them from using its time and timezone conversion tools within their development environment (e.g., Claude Desktop, Zed). The core problem is a functional bug in the upstream package that needs to be resolved.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goal is to create a functional, forked version of the `mcp-server-time` package that is free of the user-reported error. This new package, `pape-mcp-server-time`, will serve as a direct replacement, allowing the user to leverage its time-related tools without issues.

## 3. How It Should Work

- The `pape-mcp-server-time` package should be a drop-in replacement for the original `mcp-server-time`.
- It should expose the same set of tools: `get_current_time` and `convert_time`.
- It should be installable and runnable via `uv` and `pip`.
- When run, it should start an MCP server without the error encountered in the original package.
- The user should be able to configure it in their MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) and use its tools to perform time and timezone conversions successfully.

## 4. User Experience

The ideal user experience is seamless and error-free. The user should be able to:

1. Install the forked package easily.
2. Run it locally without encountering the original error.
3. Integrate it into their development workflow as if it were the official package.
4. Trust that the time and timezone conversions are accurate and reliable.
