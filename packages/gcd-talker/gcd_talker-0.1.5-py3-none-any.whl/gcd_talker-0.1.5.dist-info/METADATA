# Grand Comics Database™ plugin for Comic Tagger

A plugin for [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/releases) to allow the use of the metadata from [Grand Comics Database™](https://www.comics.org).

## Obtaining the SQLite DB

1. Create an account on the [GCD](https://www.comics.org).
2. Download the latest SQLite3 dump of their DB (minus images and image URLs) at https://www.comics.org/download/

### Cover images

**GCD does not make their image URLs available via their DB dumps**

An option is available to attempt to download the covers in the GUI and separately for auto-tagging.
Due to occasional CloudFlare activation, images may not download.

## Installation

The easiest installation method as of ComicTagger 1.6.0-beta.1 for the plugin is to place the [release](https://github.com/comictagger/gcd_talker/releases) zip file
`gcd_talker-plugin-<version>.zip` into the [plugins](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/wiki/Installing-plugins) directory.

## Development Installation

You can build the wheel with `tox run -m build` or clone ComicTagger and clone the talker and install the talker into the ComicTagger environment `pip install -e .`
