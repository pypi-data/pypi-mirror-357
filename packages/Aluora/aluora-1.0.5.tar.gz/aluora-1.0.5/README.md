# Aluora

**Aluora** is a Python library for hallucination detection in text generated by large language models (LLMs). It integrates multiple detection methods to assess the risk that a given response is unsupported or fabricated relative to its context and question.

## üîç Features

-  **HalluDetect**: Dropout-based DenseNet model with MC Dropout and mutual information for uncertainty estimation.
-  **HHEM**: Semantic consistency scoring using a pretrained transformer classifier.
-  **LettuceDetect**: Span-level hallucination detection using contextual lexical evaluatio
-  **JSON Output** for structured evaluation results.

##  Installation
```bash
pip install aluora
```

##  Example Usage
```python
from Aluora.core.extractor import hallucination_metrics

hallucination_metrics(
    context="The robot was built in 2023.",
    question="When was the robot built?",
    answer="The robot was built in 2023.",
    output_json_path="results.json"  # path to save output as JSON
)
```

##  Output Structure
```json
{
  "halludetect": {
    "predicted_class": 0,
    "label": "Hallucination",
