"""
MetaclassException provides a vastly improved exception to replace the
default 'all your base are belong to us' exception raised by metaclass
incompatibility.

For example, let MetaFoo and MetaBar both be metaclasses based on type.
Let Bar be derived from MetaBar. Then when trying to derive Foo from
MetaFoo whilst also based on Bar, we have the incompatibility:

class MetaFoo(type): pass

class MetaBar(type): pass

class Bar(metaclass=MetaBar): pass

class Foo(Bar, metaclass=MetaFoo): pass  # raises

When trying to create the class Foo, we get this bit of syntactic broccoli:
'TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a
(non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases'

What this is trying to communicate is that baseclasses must be derived
from the same metaclass or subclass as the new class. MetaclassException
will instead provide a much clearer message that also references
specifically which base class and metaclass is causing the issue.

Metaclass conflict while defining class 'Foo':

- Foo derives from metaclass 'MetaFoo'
- While also based on class 'Bar' derived from 'MetaBar'
- But 'MetaBar' is not 'MetaFoo' nor a subclass of 'MetaFoo'.

Classes must be based on baseclasses derived from the same metaclass or
subclass of it.
