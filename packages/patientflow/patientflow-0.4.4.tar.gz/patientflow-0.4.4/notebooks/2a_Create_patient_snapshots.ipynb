    "## About snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "`patientflow` is organised around the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction time: A moment in the day at which predictions are to be made, for example 09:30.\n",
    "- Patient snapshot: A summary of data from the EHR capturing is known about a single patient at the prediction time. Each patient snapshot has a date and a prediction time associated with it.\n",
    "- Group snapshot: A set of patient snapshots. Each group snapshot has a date and a prediction time associated with it.\n",
    "- Prediction window: A period of hours that begins at the prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `patientflow` your data should be in snapshot form. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I suggest how to you might prepare your data, starting from past hospital visits that have already finished. I start with fake data on Emergency Department visits, and demonstrate how to convert it into snapshots. There are two examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* A simple example of creating snapshots assuming you have one flat table of hospital visits\n",
    "* An example of creating snapshots from data structured as if a relational database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on creating your own shapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "The snapshot creation shown here is designed to work with fake data generated below. You would need to create your own version of this process, to handle the data you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, deciding from data *whether a patient was admitted after the ED visit*, and *when they were ready to be admitted*, can be tricky. How do you account for the fact that the patient may wait in the ED for a bed, due to lack of available beds? Likewise, if you are trying to predict discharge at the end of a hospital visit, should that that be the time they were ready to leave, or the time they actually left? Discharge delays are common, due to waiting for medication or transport, or waiting for onward care provision to become available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome that you are aiming for will depend on your setting. You may have to infer when a patient was ready from available data. Suffice to say, think carefully about what it is you are trying to predict, and how you will identify that outcome in data. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have shown how to create snapshots from finished patient visits. Note that there is summarisation involved. The lab orders have been summarised into counts, and the latest triage score has been taken. In the same vein, you might just take the last recorded heart rate or oxygen saturation level, or the latest value of a lab result. A snapshot loses some of the richness of the full data in an EHR, but with the benefit that you get data that replicate unfinished visits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask why we don't use time series data, to hang on to that richness. The main reason is that hospital visit data can be very patchy. For example, in the ED, a severely ill patient might have enough heart rate values recorded to constitute a time series, while a non-acute patient (say someone with a sprained ankle) might have one or no heart rate measurements. This data missingness is not a problem, however. In the case of predicting probability of admission after ED, the absence of data is revealing in itself. By summarising, snapshots allow us to capture that variation in data completeness. \n",
