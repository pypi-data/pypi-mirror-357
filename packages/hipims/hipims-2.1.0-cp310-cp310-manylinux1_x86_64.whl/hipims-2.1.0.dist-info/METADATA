Summary: HiPIMS names for High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System. It uses state-of-art numerical schemes (Godunov-type finite volume) to solve the 2D shallow water equations for flood simulations. To support high-resolution flood simulations, HiPIMS is implemented on multiple GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) using CUDA/C++ languages to achieve high-performance computing.

# High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System ***hybrid***

This is a beta version inhouse code of Hemlab used for high-performance flooding simulation.


## About
HiPIMS names for High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System. It uses state-of-art numerical schemes (Godunov-type finite volume) to solve the 2D shallow water equations for flood simulations. To support high-resolution flood simulations, HiPIMS is implemented on multiple GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) using CUDA/C++ languages to achieve high-performance computing. To find out how to use the model, please see the wiki.

### Contributing
HiPIMS is maintained by the Hydro-Environmental Modelling Labarotory [URL](https://www.hemlab.org/), a research hub for technological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. We warmly welcome the hydro-environmental modelling community to contribute to the project, believing that this project will benefit the whole community.

 [Qiuhua Liang](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/abce/staff/qiuhua-liang/), ([Q.Liang@lboro.ac.uk](mailto:Q.Liang@lboro.ac.uk)) is the Head of HEMLab.
