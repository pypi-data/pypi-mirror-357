[*OptunaHub*](https://hub.optuna.org/) is a platform for sharing algorithms in [Optuna](https://optuna.org/), a powerful and flexible hyperparameter optimization framework. OptunaHub provides implementations of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and visualization of optimization results for analysis. You can also publish your algorithm implementation on the platform and make it available to Optuna users around the world.


This is the repository of the optunahub Python Library to use packages published in [OptunaHub](https://hub.optuna.org/). If you would like to register your package in OptunaHub, please contribute by creating a pull request to [the optunahub-registry repository](https://github.com/optuna/optunahub-registry).

## Installation

OptunaHub is available at [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/optunahub/).

```sh
pip install optunahub
```

## Example

You only need to search for the desired function on [the OptunaHub website](https://hub.optuna.org/) and call the [optunahub.load_module](https://optuna.github.io/optunahub/) function in your code to incorporate it.

```python
import optuna
import optunahub


def objective(trial: optuna.Trial) -> float:
  x = trial.suggest_float("x", -5, 5)
  y = trial.suggest_float("y", -5, 5)
  return x**2 + y**2


module = optunahub.load_module(package="samplers/auto_sampler")
study = optuna.create_study(sampler=module.AutoSampler())
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)

print(study.best_trial.value, study.best_trial.params)
```
