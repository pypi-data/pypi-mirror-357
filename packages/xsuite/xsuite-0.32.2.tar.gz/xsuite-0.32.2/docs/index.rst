Xsuite
======

Xsuite is a collection python packages for the simulation of the beam dynamics
in particle accelerators. It supports different computing platforms,
in particular conventional CPUs and and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs).

Xsuite is composed by the following packages:
 - **Xobjects**: infrastructure to manage the memory, compile and execute code on different computing platforms;
 - **Xpart**: package to generate and manipulate ensembles of particles;
 - **Xtrack**: single-particle tracking library, creation/import of beam line descriptions;
 - **Xfields**: computation of the electromagnetic fields generated by particle ensembles using Particle In Cell (PIC) solvers or analytical distributions.
 - **Xdeps**: management of the dependencies, implementation of deferred expressions.
 - **Xcoll**: simulation of particle-matter interaction through a native engine
   and through interfaces with the FLUKA and Geant4 codes.

The Xsuite documentation includes:
   - a :doc:`user's guide <usersguide>` describing the installation and the main
     functionalities of Xsuite and its usage for several applications;
   - a :doc:`reference guide <apireference>` describing interface of all the
     modules and classes of Xsuite;
   - a :doc:`physics guide <physicsguide>` describing the physics models implemented
     in the code;
   - a :doc:`developer's guide <developer>` describing the code internals and how
     to add new features.

The source code is available in these `GitHub repositories <https://github.com/xsuite/>`_.

Community
---------

The Xsuite community is open to feedback and contributions.
In case of any questions, suggestions or issues feel free to open an
`issue on the Xsuite GitHub page <https://github.com/xsuite/xsuite>`_. We also
host the Xsuite community on `CERN Mattermost <https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/xsuite>`_,
where you can ask questions and discuss with the developers and other users.
The Mattermost community is accessible to anyone with a CERN account, and a guest
account can easily be created for those unaffiliated with CERN, by simply
