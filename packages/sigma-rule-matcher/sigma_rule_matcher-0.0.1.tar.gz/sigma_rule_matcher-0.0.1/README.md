## What is this?

**`sigma-rule-matcher`** is a Python package for evaluating [Sigma detection rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) against structured event data. Built on top of [PySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma), it parses and applies Sigma rule logic—including condition expressions and most common modifiers—to incoming events to determine whether they match.

The project is primarily a learning tool, hacked together to better understand how Sigma rules operate under the hood.
