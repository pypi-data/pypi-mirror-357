VIPY: Python Tools for Visual Dataset Transformation    
Documentation: https://visym.github.io/vipy

VIPY is a python package for representation, transformation and visualization of annotated videos and images.  Annotations are the ground truth provided by labelers for training and testing computer vision systems.  VIPY provides tools to easily edit videos and images so that the annotations are transformed along with the pixels.  This enables a clean interface for transforming complex datasets for input to your computer vision pipeline.

VIPY provides:  

* Representation of videos with labeled activities that can be resized, clipped, rotated, scaled, padded, cropped and resampled
* Representation of images with object bounding boxes that can be manipulated as easily as editing an image
* Clean visualization of annotated images and video
* Fluent interface for chaining operations on videos and images
* Lazy loading of images and videos suitable for distributed processing (e.g. dask, spark)
* Straightforward integration into machine learning toolchains (e.g. torch, numpy)
* Visual dataset download, unpack and import (e.g. Imagenet21k, Coco 2014, Visual Genome, Open Images V7, Kinetics700, YoutubeBB, ActivityNet, ... )
* Minimum dependencies for easy installation (e.g. AWS Lambda, Flask)


Requirements
-------------------
python 3.7+  
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (required for videos)  
numpy, matplotlib, pillow, ffmpeg-python   


Installation
-------------------

```python
pip install vipy
```

Optional dependencies are installable as a complete package:

```python
pip install pip --upgrade
pip install 'vipy[all]'
```

You will receive a friendly warning if attempting to use an optional dependency before installation.


Quickstart
-------------------
```python
import vipy
vipy.image.owl().minsquare().show()
```

vipy.dataset.registry('coco_2014').takeone().show()
```

```python
v = vipy.dataset.registry('youtubeBB').takeone()
vipy.visualize.montage([im.centersquare().mindim(256).annotate() for t in v.download().trackclip() for im in t.framerate(1)]).show()
```
