# VF3Py

Interfacing Python and NetworkX with VF3 – the fastest algorithm for graph/subgraph isomorphism calculation.

## Setup

Make sure that your OS is Linux and Python version is >= 3.8.

VF3Py can be installed using this command:

```
pip install vf3py
```
Test your installation:

```
$ python
>>> import vf3py.test
>>> vf3py.test.run_tests()
(...lots of output...)
OK
>>> 
```

## Other projects that use VF3Py

For now, all projects are mine:

* [algebra_repr](https://gitlab.com/knvvv/algebra_repr) (TODO: come up with a better name) -- uses SageMath to construct finite algebraic structures (groups, rings, fields), then represents them as graphs. Graph isomorphism allows to check if any two algebraic structures are isomorphic or not.

* [PyXYZ](https://gitlab.com/knvvv/pyxyz) -- A Python Library for Molecular Geometry Manipulation. TODO: Use VF3Py to generate automorphisms groups for molecular graphs.
