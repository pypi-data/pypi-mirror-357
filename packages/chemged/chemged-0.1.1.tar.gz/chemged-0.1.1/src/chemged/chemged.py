class ApproximateChemicalGED:
    r"""
    Calculator for approximate graph edit distance (GED) between two chemical graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost_matrix : ChemicalGEDCostMatrix
        the cost matrix that defines the costs of node and edge edit operations
        on the chemical graphs.

    Notes
    -----
    This implements a bipartite graph matching algorithm to approximate GED[1]_.

    The algorithm requires a way to compute the cost matrix of node and edge edit operations
    between two graphs. The cost matrix between two graphs is defined square matrix of size
    number of nodes in graph 1 + number of nodes in graph 2.

    .. math::

    \\mathbf{C} =
    \\begin{bmatrix}
    c_{1,1} & c_{1,2} & \\cdots & c_{1,m} & c_{1,\\epsilon} & \\infty & \\cdots & \\infty \\\\
    c_{2,1} & c_{2,2} & \\cdots & c_{2,m} & \\infty & c_{2,\\epsilon} & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\infty \\\\
    c_{n,1} & c_{n,2} & \\cdots & c_{n,m} & \\infty & \\cdots & \\infty & c_{n,\\epsilon}\\\\
    c_{\\epsilon, 1} & \\infty & \\cdots & \\infty & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\
    \\infty & c_{\\epsilon, 2} & \\ddots & \\vdots & 0 & 0 & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
    \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\infty & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\
    \\infty & \\cdots & \\infty & c_{\\epsilon, m} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\
    \\end{bmatrix}

    where :math:`c_{n,m}` is the cost of substituting node :math:`n` in graph :math:`n1`
    with node :math:`m` in graph :math:`n2`, :math:`c_{n,\\epsilon}` is the cost of deleting
    a node from :math:`n1`, and :math:`c_{\\epsilon,m}` is the cost of inserting node
    :math:`m` from :math:`n2` into :math:`n1`.

    Nodes can only be deleted or inserted once, so only the diagonals are populated in the
    insertion (bottom left) and deletion (upper right) sections of the cost matrix.
    The cost of doing another insertion or deletion is set to infinity, as it is not allowed.
    Particularly, we set it to the largest integer value to avoid numerical issues with the
    implementation of Munkres algorithm used by SciPy.
    The bottom right is always 0, as it represents the cost of substituting a missing node with
    another missing node, which has no cost.

    Then the Munkres algorithm is applied to find the optimal assignment of nodes and edges
    between the two graphs that minimizes the total cost of the edit operations.
    These costs are then summed to approximate the graph edit distance

        Will convert the chemicals to rdkit.Mol objects if they are not already,
