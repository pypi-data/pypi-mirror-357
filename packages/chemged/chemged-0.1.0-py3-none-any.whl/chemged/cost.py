class ChemicalGEDCostMatrix(abc.ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for chemical graph edit distance cost matrix

    These Matrices are used to determine the cost of any edit operation.

    The costs of node substitution, insertion and deletion costs
    need to be defined. These should return a cost matrix (for substitution)
    or a cost vector (for insertion and deletion) of the nodes.
    This is done by the functions
    - `get_node_substitution_costs`
    - `get_node_insertion_costs`
    - `get_node_deletion_costs`

    Likewise, the cost functions for edge substitution, insertion and deletion
    are needed. These are a bit different. Rather than operating on the whole graph,
    they operate locally on the nodes. They should return a cost matrix (substitution)
    or a cost vector (insertion and deletion) of the edges *for the two given nodes*
    only. So if we have two nodes n1 (from graph1) and n2 (from graph2), and n1 has
    a degree of 3 (3 bonds) and n2 has a degree of 2 (2 bonds), then the substitution
    cost matrix should be of size 3x2, where the element at position (i, j) is the
    substitution cost of the i-th bond of n1 with the j-th bond of n2. Likewise,
    the deletion/insertion cost vector should be the same size as the respective node's degree.

        You can get the adjacency list of a node in a graph from network x using
        graph.adj[n] OR using g[n] where n is the node key/index. These are called
        `AtlasViews` in NetworkX and can be treated as dictionaries for the most part.

class UniformElementCostMatrix(ChemicalGEDCostMatrix):
    """
    A uniform cost matrix for chemical graph edit distance.

    This cost matrix assumes all substitutions, insertions, and deletions of atoms
    are worth a cost of 1, not matter which type the atom is *or* what type the
    atom was swapped into. The same goes for bonds, where all bond substitutions,
    insertions, and deletions are worth a cost of 1, regardless of the bond type.

    This is good for if you want to measure GED in a more "pure" sense, where
    we are just asking how much the graph representing a chemical has changed.
    If you want to account for chemical properties, you should write a more
    advanced cost matrix that takes into account the atom and bond types.
    For example, minimize cost for O to N substitutions if they are both
    Hydrogen bond donors, but increase the cost for O to C substitutions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_sub_cost : float, default=1.0
        The uniform cost of substituting a node (atom).
    node_ins_cost : float, default=1.0
        The uniform cost of inserting a node (atom).
    node_del_cost : float, default=1.0
