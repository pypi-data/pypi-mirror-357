## Usage Examples

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

```python
import numpy as np
from algomake.models.gmm import GaussianMixture

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
data_1 = np.random.multivariate_normal([2.0, 2.0], [[0.5, 0.2], [0.2, 0.5]], 100)
data_2 = np.random.multivariate_normal([8.0, 8.0], [[0.7, -0.3], [-0.3, 0.7]], 100)
X_train = np.vstack((data_1, data_2))

gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, random_state=42, max_iter=100, tol=1e-4)
gmm.fit(X_train)

X_new = np.array([[2.1, 1.9], [8.3, 7.8], [5.0, 5.0]])
predicted_labels = gmm.predict(X_new)
probabilities = gmm.predict_proba(X_new)

print("Labels:", predicted_labels)
print("Probabilities:", np.round(probabilities, 4))
```

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```python
import numpy as np
from algomake.preprocessing.dimensionality_reduction import PCA

X = np.array([
    [2.5, 2.4], [0.5, 0.7], [2.2, 2.9],
    [1.9, 2.2], [3.1, 3.0], [2.3, 2.7],
    [2.0, 1.6], [1.0, 1.1], [1.5, 1.6], [1.1, 0.9]
])

pca = PCA(n_components=1)
pca.fit(X)
X_transformed = pca.transform(X)

print("Transformed Data:", np.round(X_transformed, 3))
```
