# pySpainMobility

## A Python package to access, download and starndardise 
![logo small](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pySpainMobility/pySpainMobility/refs/heads/main/logo_small.png)

Mobility patterns play a critical role in a wide range of societal challenges, from epidemic modeling and emergency response to transportation planning and regional development. Yet, access to high-quality, timely, and openly available mobility data remains limited. In response, the [Spanish Ministry of Transportation and Sustainable Mobility](https://www.transportes.gob.es) has released daily [mobility datasets](https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/metodologia-del-estudio-de-movilidad-con-bigdata) based on anonymized mobile phone data, covering districts, municipalities, and greater urban areas from February 2020 to June 2021 (`version 1`) and again from January 2022 onward (`version 2`). `pySpainMobility` is a Python package that simplifies access to these datasets and their associated spatial tessellations through a standardized, well-documented interface. By lowering the technical barrier to working with large-scale mobility data, the package enables reproducible analysis and supports applications across research, policy, and operational domains.

The full documentation of the library is available on the [`pySpainMobility` website](https://pyspainmobility.github.io/pySpainMobility) and a paper with some examples and further details is available on arXiv. If you are using the library or it content, please use this reference:

## Installation
scikit-mobility for Python >= 3.8 and all it's dependencies are available from conda-forge and can be installed using
`conda install -c conda-forge scikit-mobility`.

Note that it is **NOT recommended** to install scikit-mobility from PyPI! If you're on Windows or Mac, many GeoPandas / scikit-mobility dependencies cannot be pip installed (for details see the corresponding notes in the GeoPandas documentation).
