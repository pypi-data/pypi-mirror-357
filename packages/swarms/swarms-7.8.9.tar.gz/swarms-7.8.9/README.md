## `Agent` Class
The `Agent` class is a customizable autonomous component of the Swarms framework that integrates LLMs, tools, and long-term memory. Its `run` method processes text tasks and optionally handles image inputs through vision-language models.


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent] --> B[Initialize]
    B --> C[Process Task]
    C --> D[Execute Tools]
    D --> E[Generate Response]
    E --> F[Return Output]
    C --> G[Long-term Memory]
    G --> C
```




## Simple Example

```python
from swarms import Agent

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Stock-Analysis-Agent",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    streaming_on=True,
)

agent.run("What is the current market trend for tech stocks?")

```

### Settings and Customization

The `Agent` class offers a range of settings to tailor its behavior to specific needs. Some key settings include:

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_name` | The name of the agent. | "DefaultAgent" |

| `dashboard` | Enables or disables the dashboard for the agent. | False |
| `verbose` | Controls the verbosity of the agent's output. | False |
| `dynamic_temperature_enabled` | Enables or disables dynamic temperature adjustment for the language model. | False |
| `saved_state_path` | The path to save the agent's state. | "agent_state.json" |
| `user_name` | The username associated with the agent. | "default_user" |
| `retry_attempts` | The number of retry attempts for failed tasks. | 1 |
| `context_length` | The maximum length of the context to consider for tasks. | 200000 |
| `return_step_meta` | Controls whether to return step metadata in the output. | False |
| `output_type` | The type of output to return (e.g., "json", "string"). | "string" |


```python
import os
from swarms import Agent

from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import (
    FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
)
# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,

### Integrating RAG with Swarms for Enhanced Long-Term Memory

`Agent` equipped with quasi-infinite long term memory using RAG (Relational Agent Graph) for advanced document understanding, analysis, and retrieval capabilities.

**Mermaid Diagram for RAG Integration**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initialize Agent with RAG] --> B[Receive Task]
    B --> C[Query Long-Term Memory]
    C --> D[Process Task with Context]
    D --> E[Generate Response]
    E --> F[Update Long-Term Memory]
    F --> G[Return Output]
```

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import (
    FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
)
import os

from swarms_memory import ChromaDB

# Initialize the ChromaDB client for long-term memory management
chromadb = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",  # Metric for similarity measurement
    output_dir="finance_agent_rag",  # Directory for storing RAG data
    # docs_folder="artifacts",  # Uncomment and specify the folder containing your documents
)

# Initialize the agent with RAG capabilities
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    agent_description="Agent creates a comprehensive financial analysis",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops="auto",  # Auto-adjusts loops based on task complexity
    autosave=True,  # Automatically saves agent state
    dashboard=False,  # Disables dashboard for this example
    verbose=True,  # Enables verbose mode for detailed output
    streaming_on=True,  # Enables streaming for real-time processing
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,  # Dynamically adjusts temperature for optimal performance
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",  # Path to save agent state
    user_name="swarms_corp",  # User name for the agent
    retry_attempts=3,  # Number of retry attempts for failed tasks
    context_length=200000,  # Maximum length of the context to consider
    long_term_memory=chromadb,  # Integrates ChromaDB for long-term memory management
    return_step_meta=False,
    output_type="string",
)

# Run the agent with a sample task
agent.run(
    "What are the components of a startup's stock incentive equity plan"
)
```

### `Agent`with Pydantic BaseModel as Output Type
The following is an example of an agent that intakes a pydantic basemodel and outputs it at the same time:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from swarms import Agent


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(..., title="Whether the person is a student")
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = Schema(
    name="Tool Name",
    agent=1,
    is_student=True,
    courses=["Course1", "Course2"],
)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"

# Initialize the agent

### Multi Modal Autonomous Agent
Run the agent with multiple modalities useful for various real-world tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and health.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent

from swarm_models import GPT4VisionAPI

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()


# Initialize the language model
llm = GPT4VisionAPI(
    openai_api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    max_tokens=500,
)

# Initialize the task
task = (
    "Analyze this image of an assembly line and identify any issues such as"
    " misaligned parts, defects, or deviations from the standard assembly"
    " process. If there is anything unsafe in the image, explain why it is"
    " unsafe and how it could be improved."
)
img = "assembly_line.jpg"

## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(
    agent_name = "Multi-ModalAgent",
    llm=llm, 
    max_loops="auto", 
    autosave=True, 
    dashboard=True,

### Local Agent `ToolAgent`
ToolAgent is a fully local agent that can use tools through JSON function calling. It intakes any open source model from huggingface and is extremely modular and plug in and play. We need help adding general support to all models soon.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

from swarms import ToolAgent
from swarms.tools.json_utils import base_model_to_json

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dolly-v2-12b",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-12b")


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(
        ..., title="Whether the person is a student"
    )
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = base_model_to_json(Schema)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = (
    "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
)

# Create an instance of the ToolAgent class
agent = ToolAgent(
    name="dolly-function-agent",
    description="An agent to create a child's data",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=tool_schema,
)

# Run the agent to generate the person's information
generated_data = agent.run(task)

# Print the generated data
print(f"Generated data: {generated_data}")

## Understanding Swarms

A swarm refers to a group of more than two agents working collaboratively to achieve a common goal. These agents can be software entities, such as llms that interact with each other to perform complex tasks. The concept of a swarm is inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks, where simple individual behaviors lead to complex group dynamics and problem-solving capabilities.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Swarm] --> B[Agent 1]
    A --> C[Agent 2]
    A --> D[Agent N]
    B --> E[Task Processing]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[Result Aggregation]
    F --> G[Final Output]
```

### How Swarm Architectures Facilitate Communication

Swarm architectures are designed to establish and manage communication between agents within a swarm. These architectures define how agents interact, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Here are some key aspects of swarm architectures:

1. **Hierarchical Communication**: In hierarchical swarms, communication flows from higher-level agents to lower-level agents. Higher-level agents act as coordinators, distributing tasks and aggregating results. This structure is efficient for tasks that require top-down control and decision-making.

2. **Parallel Communication**: In parallel swarms, agents operate independently and communicate with each other as needed. This architecture is suitable for tasks that can be processed concurrently without dependencies, allowing for faster execution and scalability.

3. **Sequential Communication**: Sequential swarms process tasks in a linear order, where each agent's output becomes the input for the next agent. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled in the correct sequence, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Hierarchical] --> D[Task Distribution]
    B[Parallel] --> E[Concurrent Processing]
    C[Sequential] --> F[Linear Processing]
    D --> G[Results]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

Swarm architectures leverage these communication patterns to ensure that agents work together efficiently, adapting to the specific requirements of the task at hand. By defining clear communication protocols and interaction models, swarm architectures enable the seamless orchestration of multiple agents, leading to enhanced performance and problem-solving capabilities.

### `SequentialWorkflow`

The SequentialWorkflow in the Swarms framework enables sequential task execution across multiple Agent objects. Each agent's output serves as input for the next agent in the sequence, continuing until reaching the specified maximum number of loops (max_loops). This workflow is particularly well-suited for tasks requiring a specific order of operations, such as data processing pipelines.

## `AgentRearrange`

The `AgentRearrange` orchestration technique, inspired by Einops and einsum, enables you to define and map relationships between multiple agents. This powerful tool facilitates the orchestration of complex workflows by allowing you to specify both linear and concurrent relationships. For example, you can create sequential workflows like `a -> a1 -> a2 -> a3` or parallel workflows where a single agent distributes tasks to multiple agents simultaneously: `a -> a1, a2, a3`. This flexibility enables the creation of highly efficient and dynamic workflows, with agents operating either in parallel or sequence as required. As a valuable addition to the swarms library, `AgentRearrange` provides enhanced flexibility and precise control over agent orchestration. For comprehensive information and examples, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). [Watch my video tutorial on agent rearrange!](https://youtu.be/Rq8wWQ073mg)

## `GraphWorkflow`


GraphWorkflow is a workflow management system using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to orchestrate complex tasks. Nodes (agents or tasks) and edges define dependencies, with agents executing tasks concurrently. It features entry/end points, visualization for debugging, and scalability for dynamic task assignment. Benefits include concurrency, flexibility, scalability, and clear workflow visualization. [Learn more:](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/graph_swarm/) The `run` method returns a dictionary containing the execution results of all nodes in the graph.



```python
from swarms import Agent, Edge, GraphWorkflow, Node, NodeType

## `ForestSwarm`

The `ForestSwarm` architecture is an intelligent system designed to optimize task assignment by dynamically selecting the most appropriate agent from a collection of specialized trees. Through asynchronous task processing, the system intelligently matches tasks with agents based on their relevance. This matching is accomplished by computing the semantic similarity between each agent's system prompts and the keywords present in the task. For comprehensive details about the `ForestSwarm` implementation and capabilities, please consult the [official documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/forest_swarm/).

## `SwarmRouter`

The `SwarmRouter` class is a flexible routing system designed to manage different types of swarms for task execution. It provides a unified interface to interact with various swarm types, including `AgentRearrange`, `MixtureOfAgents`, `SpreadSheetSwarm`, `SequentialWorkflow`, and `ConcurrentWorkflow`. We will be continuously adding more and more swarm architectures here as we progress with new architectures. [Learn More](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow
)

concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="ConcurrentRouter",
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow
)
```

### AgentRearrange

```python
rearrange_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="TaskOptimizer",
    description="Optimize agent order for multi-step tasks",
    max_loops=3,
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.AgentRearrange,
    flow = f"{data_extractor.name} -> {analyzer.name} -> {summarizer.name}"
)

result = rearrange_router.run("Analyze and summarize the quarterly financial report")
```

## MultiAgentRouter

The MultiAgentRouter is a swarm architecture designed to dynamically assign tasks to the most suitable agent. It achieves this through a director or boss entity that utilizes function calls to identify and allocate tasks to the agent best equipped to handle them. [Check out the documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/multi_agent_router/)

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.multi_agent_orchestrator import MultiAgentRouter

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define some example agents
    agents = [
        Agent(
            agent_name="ResearchAgent",
            description="Specializes in researching topics and providing detailed, factual information",
            system_prompt="You are a research specialist. Provide detailed, well-researched information about any topic, citing sources when possible.",
            model_name="openai/gpt-4o",
        ),
        Agent(
            agent_name="CodeExpertAgent",
            description="Expert in writing, reviewing, and explaining code across multiple programming languages",
            system_prompt="You are a coding expert. Write, review, and explain code with a focus on best practices and clean code principles.",
            model_name="openai/gpt-4o",
        ),
        Agent(
            agent_name="WritingAgent",
            description="Skilled in creative and technical writing, content creation, and editing",
            system_prompt="You are a writing specialist. Create, edit, and improve written content while maintaining appropriate tone and style.",
            model_name="openai/gpt-4o",
        ),
    ]

    # Initialize routers with different configurations
    router_execute = MultiAgentRouter(agents=agents, execute_task=True)

    # Example task
    task = "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

    try:
        # Process the task with execution
        print("\nWith task execution:")
        result_execute = router_execute.route_task(task)
        print(result_execute)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
```
