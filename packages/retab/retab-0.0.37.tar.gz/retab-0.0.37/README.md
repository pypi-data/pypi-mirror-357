## How It Works

UiForm allows you to easily create document processing automations. Here is the general workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User ->> UiForm: File Upload
    UiForm -->> UiForm: Preprocessing
    UiForm ->> AI Provider: Request on your behalf
    AI Provider -->> UiForm:  Structured Generation
    UiForm ->> Webhook: Send result
    UiForm ->> User: Send Confirmation
```

## General philosophy

Many people haven't yet realized how powerful LLMs have become at document processing tasks - **we're here to help you unlock these capabilities**.

Our mission can be described as follows:

- **Smarter Document Processing**
> Convert any file type (PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.) into LLM-ready format without touching any line of code.

- **Scalable Workflow Automation**
> Create custom automation loops to process documents at scale.

- **Model Efficiency & Cost Optimization**
> Get consistent, reliable outputs using schema-based prompt engineering to reduce costs and improve performance.

You come with your own API key from your favorite AI provider, and we handle the rest in an **easy** and **transparent** way.

We currently support [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) and [xAI](https://x.ai/api) models.

## Dev Mode üîß

You need more control? You can access the [Documentation](https://docs.uiform.com/get-started/introduction) of our **Python SDK**.

1. **Setup the Python SDK**
> Install the UiForm Python SDK and configure your API keys to start processing documents with your preferred AI provider.

2. **Create your JSON schema**
> Define the structure of the data you want to extract from your documents using our schema format with custom prompting capabilities.

3. **Create your FastAPI server with a webhook**
> Set up an endpoint that will receive the structured data extracted from your documents after processing.

4. **Create your automation**
> Configure an automation (mailbox or link) that will automatically process incoming documents using your schema and send results to your webhook.

5. **Test your automation**
> Validate your setup by sending test documents through your automation and verify the extracted data matches your requirements.

### Step 1: Setup of the Python SDK

To get started, install the `uiform` package using pip:

```bash
pip install uiform
```

Then, [create your API key on uiform.com](https://www.uiform.com).

Create another API key by you favorite API key provider. 

**Reminder**: We currently support [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) and [xAI](https://x.ai/api) models.

As we will use your API key to make requests to OpenAI on your behalf within an automation, you need to store your API key in the UiForm secrets manager:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxx
UIFORM_API_KEY=sk_uiform_xxxxxxxxx
```

```bash
import uiform
import os

uiclient = uiform.UiForm()

uiclient.secrets.external_api_keys.create(
    provider="OpenAI", 
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

#### Process your first document with the create_messages method:

```bash
from uiform import UiForm
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize UiForm client
uiclient = UiForm()

# Convert any document into LLM-ready format
doc_msg = uiclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"  # Works with PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.
)

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-nano",
    messages=doc_msg.openai_messages + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize the document"
        }
    ]
)
```

### Step 2: Create your JSON Schema

We use a standard JSON Schema with custom annotations (`X-SystemPrompt`, `X-FieldPrompt`, and `X-ReasoningPrompt`) as a prompt-engineering framework for the extraction process.

These annotations help guide the LLM‚Äôs behavior and improve extraction accuracy. 

You can learn more about these in our [JSON Schema documentation](https://docs.uiform.com/get-started/prompting-with-the-JSON-schema).

```bash
from uiform import UiForm
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

# Define your extraction schema
class Invoice(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        json_schema_extra = {
            "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents."
        }
    )
    
    total_amount: float = Field(...,
        description="The total invoice amount",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-FieldPrompt": "Find the final total amount including taxes"
        }
    )
    date: str = Field(...,
        description="Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Look for dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Date', etc."
        }
    )

# Process document and extract data
uiclient = UiForm()
doc_msg = uiclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"
)
schema_obj = uiclient.schemas.load(
    pydantic_model = Invoice
)

# Extract structured data with any LLM
client = OpenAI()
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=schema_obj.openai_messages + doc_msg.openai_messages,
    response_format=schema_obj.inference_pydantic_model
)

print("Extracted data:", completion.choices[0].message.parsed)

# Validate the response against the original schema if you want to remove the reasoning fields
from uiform._utils.json_schema import filter_auxiliary_fields_json
assert completion.choices[0].message.content is not None
extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(completion.choices[0].message.content, schema_obj.pydantic_model)
)

print("Extracted data without the reasoning fields:", extraction)
```

### Step 3: Create your FastAPI server with a webhook

Next, set up a FastAPI route that will handle incoming webhook POST requests. 

Below is an example of a simple FastAPI application with a webhook endpoint:

```bash
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from uiform.types.automations.webhooks import WebhookRequest
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(request: WebhookRequest):
    invoice_object = request.completion.choices[0].message.parsed # The parsed object is the same Invoice object as the one you defined in the Pydantic model
    print("Received payload:", invoice_object)
    return JSONResponse(content={"status": "success", "data": invoice_object})

# To run the FastAPI app locally, use the command:
# uvicorn your_module_name:app --reload
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

You can test the webhook endpoint locally with a tool like curl or Postman - for example, using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/webhook" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Team Meeting", "date": "2023-12-31"}'
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **To continue**, you need to deploy your FastAPI app to a server to make your webhook endpoint publicly accessible.  
> We recommend using [Replit](https://replit.com) to get started quickly if you don‚Äôt have a server yet.

### Step 4: Create your automation

Finally, integrate the webhook with your automation system using the `uiform` client. 

This example demonstrates how to create an automation that triggers the webhook when a matching event occurs:

```bash
from uiform import UiForm

# Initialize the UiForm client
uiclient = UiForm()

# Create an automation that uses the webhook URL from Step 2
automation = uiclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.create(
    email="invoices@mailbox.uiform.com",
    model="gpt-4.1-nano",
    json_schema=Invoice.model_json_schema(), # use the pydantic model to create the json schema
    webhook_url="https://your-server.com/webhook",  # Replace with your actual webhook URL
)
```

At any email sent to `invoices@mailbox.uiform.com`, the automation will send a POST request to your FastAPI webhook endpoint, where the payload can be processed.

You can see the automation you just created on your [dashboard](https://www.uiform.com/dashboard/processors)!

### Step 5: Test your automation

Finally, you can test the automation rapidly with the test functions of the sdk:

```bash
from uiform import UiForm

# Initialize the UiForm client
uiclient = UiForm()

# If you just want to send a test request to your webhook
log = uiclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.webhook(
    email="test-mailbox-local@devmail.uiform.com", 
)

# If you want to test the file processing logic: 
log = uiclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.process(
    email="test-mailbox-local@devmail.uiform.com", 
    document="your_invoice_email.eml"
)

# If you want to test a full email forwarding
log = uiclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.forward(
    email="uiform-quickstart@mailbox.uiform.com", 
    document="your_invoice_email.eml"
)
```

> üí° **Tip:** You can also test your webhook locally by overriding the webhook URL set in the automation.

```bash
from uiform import UiForm

uiclient = UiForm()

# If you just want to send a test request to your webhook
log = uiclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.webhook(
    email="test-mailbox-local@devmail.uiform.com", 
    webhook_url="http://localhost:8000/webhook" # If you want to try your webhook locally, you can override the webhook url set in the automation
)
```

And that's it! You can start processing documents at scale! 
You have 1000 free requests to get started, and you can [subscribe](https://www.uiform.com) to the pro plan to get more.

But this minimalistic example is just the beginning.
