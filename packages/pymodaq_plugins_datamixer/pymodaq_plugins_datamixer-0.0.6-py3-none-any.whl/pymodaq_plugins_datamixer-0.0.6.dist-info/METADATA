Plugin exposing an extension to the DashBoard: the DataMixer allowing to mix data from other DashBoard detectors using
scripted formula from the full name of the data or from more complex model allowing a form of live post-analysis. The
data out of the formula or out of the models can be used within the DashBoard for other extensions (for instance live
plots in a scan)

Instruments
===========

Below is the list of instruments included in this plugin


Viewer0D
++++++++

* **DataMixer**: Fake detector allowing to display the results of the extension calculations within
  the DashBoard, hence allowing those data to be used within other extensions aka the DAQ_Scan
