prompt: |
  Analyze the following code snippet and identify if it contains any LLM (Large Language Model) API usage patterns.
  Look for:
  1. Direct API calls to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  2. Framework-specific LLM usage (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)

  Code snippet:
  {code_snippet}

  IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation.
  The JSON must follow this exact structure:
  {{
    "provider": "string or null",      // e.g., "openai", "anthropic"
    "framework": "string or null",     // e.g., "langchain", "llama_index"
    "model_name": "string or null",    // e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-2"
    "confidence": float (0-1)          // confidence score
  }}

  Example responses:
  1. For OpenAI usage:
  {{
    "provider": "openai",
    "framework": null,
    "model_name": "gpt-4",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }}

  2. For LangChain usage:
  {{
    "provider": "openai",
    "framework": "langchain",
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "confidence": 0.9
  }}

  3. For no LLM usage:
  {{
    "provider": null,
    "framework": null,
    "model_name": null,
    "confidence": 0.0
  }}

  You are an expert code analyzer specialized in detecting LLM (Large Language Model) usage patterns in code.
  You have deep knowledge of various LLM frameworks, APIs, and common patterns used in LLM applications.
  Your task is to analyze code snippets and identify if they contain any LLM-related functionality.
  Be precise in identifying the provider, framework, and model name.
  Provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 based on how certain you are about the detection.
  You MUST respond with a valid JSON object only. Do not include any other text or explanation.
