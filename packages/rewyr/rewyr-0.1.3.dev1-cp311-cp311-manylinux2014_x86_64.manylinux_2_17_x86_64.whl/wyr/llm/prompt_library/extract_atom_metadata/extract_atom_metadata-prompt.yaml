  You are an expert code analyzer specialized in understanding LLM usage patterns and extracting semantic metadata.
  Your task is to analyze code containing LLM API calls and determine the task type, input/output formats, domain, and style.
  Be precise and focus on the actual purpose and context of the LLM usage.

prompt: |
  Analyze the following LLM usage in code and extract semantic metadata about its purpose and characteristics.

  # Context
  - File: {file_path}
  - Line: {line_number}
  - Provider: {provider}
  - Model: {model}

  # Code Analysis
  ```
  {code_snippet}
  ```

  # Template Information
  Template: {template}
  Parameters: {parameters}

  # Task
  Based on the code context, template content, and usage patterns, determine:

  1. **Task Type**: What kind of LLM task is this?
     - Examples: text_generation, classification, summarization, translation, question_answering, code_generation, instruction_following, creative_writing, analysis, extraction, etc.

  2. **Input Format**: What type of input does this LLM call expect?
     - Examples: text, structured_data, code, json, markdown, natural_language_query, document, image_description, etc.

  3. **Output Format**: What type of output does this LLM call produce?
     - Examples: text, json, markdown, code, classification_label, summary, translation, structured_response, boolean, etc.

  4. **Domain**: What domain or field does this LLM usage relate to?
     - Examples: general, technical, medical, legal, financial, educational, creative, business, scientific, programming, etc.

  5. **Style**: What style or tone should the LLM output have?
     - Examples: formal, casual, technical, creative, concise, detailed, professional, friendly, academic, conversational, etc.

  # Response Format
  Provide your analysis in the following JSON structure:
  ```json
  {{
    "task_type": "specific_task_type",
    "input_format": "input_type",
    "output_format": "output_type",
    "domain": "domain_area",
    "style": "output_style",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your analysis and why you chose these categories"
  }}
  ```

  # Guidelines
  - Be specific but not overly narrow in your categorizations
  - Consider the template content as the primary indicator of purpose
  - Look at variable names and context for additional clues
  - If uncertain, choose the most likely category and indicate lower confidence
  - Focus on the actual LLM task, not the surrounding application logic
  - Consider the model type (if specified) as it may indicate the intended use case

  Analyze the code and provide the metadata:

parameters:
  file_path:
    default: ""
    description: "Path to the file containing the LLM usage"

    default: 0
    description: "Line number where the LLM usage was detected"
  provider:
    default: ""
    description: "LLM provider (e.g., openai, anthropic, ollama)"
  model:
    default: ""
    description: "Specific model being used"
  code_snippet:
    default: ""
    description: "Code snippet containing the LLM usage"
  template:
    default: ""
    description: "Extracted prompt template"
  parameters:
    default: ""
    description: "Template parameters as string representation"
