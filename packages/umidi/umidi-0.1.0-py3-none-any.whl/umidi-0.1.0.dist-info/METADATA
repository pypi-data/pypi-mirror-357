Meet `umidi`, the fastest, pure-python, midi file reading library available, pronounced "micro-midi". Gives you [`attrs`](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/) classes with many utilities for all notes, events, meta messages and more. It wins by over 10x in speed compared to `pretty-midi` and/or `mido`, and is very easy to use.
