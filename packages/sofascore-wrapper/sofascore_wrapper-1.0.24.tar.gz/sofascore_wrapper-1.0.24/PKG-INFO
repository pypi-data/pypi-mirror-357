## From Me!
Will slowly be adding more sports along our journey! SofaScore API is written to re-use requests for multiple sports, So in theory making requests for a sport other than football (soccer) will allow you to make requests with any class (match, player, etc). Any requests for the dedicated sport that you cannot, they will be under the dedicated sport i.e Basketball.player_stats() rather than Player.stats()

- If you encounter any issues feel free to open an issue.
- If you have any enhancement requests, feel free to open an issue with the front end proof of what you're looking to get.
- Always open to pull requests!

*This is an unofficial API wrapper and not affiliated with Sofascore. You may be at risk via Sofascore's TOS.*

**THIS MAY NOW RETURN 403 FOR ALL REQUESTS, THIS IS A NEW CHANGE SOFASCORE HAVE IMPLETEMENTED INSTEAD OF CLOSING THE API**
