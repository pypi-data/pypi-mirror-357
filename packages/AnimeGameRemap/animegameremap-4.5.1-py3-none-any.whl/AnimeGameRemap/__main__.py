# ===== Note =====
#
# This library was auto-generated by AG Remap's APIMirrorBuilder tool,
#   a build system tool used in AG Remap's CI pipeline that creates a mirror for the existing
#   API source code since we cannot rename the original name of 'FixRaidenBoss2' to 'Anime Game Remap' in Pypi,
#   therefore, we decided to make a brand new package that mirrors the original API.
