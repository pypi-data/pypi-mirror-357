We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in
this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue at
<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.
.SH "Configuration and Compilation"
.IX Header "Configuration and Compilation"
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed compilation on platforms (e.g. "Gentoo Prefix") with only a C locale.
[GH #22569 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22569>]
Bug first reported downstream at
bugs.gentoo.org/939014 <https://bugs.gentoo.org/939014>.
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed compilation error on some systems due to a typo in a \fBprintf()\fR format.

.SH Testing
.IX Header "Testing"
Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this
release.
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IP \(bu 4
Starting in Perl 5.39.8, "\f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR" in POSIX would crash or produce odd errors
(such as \f(CW\*(C`Out of memory in perl:util:safesysmalloc\*(C'\fR) when given a format
string that wasn\*(Aqt actually a string, but a number, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, or an object
(even one with overloaded string conversion).
.Sp
Now \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR stringifies its first argument, as before.
[GH #22498 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22498>]
.IP \(bu 4
Builds with \f(CW\*(C`\-msse\*(C'\fR and quadmath on 32\-bit x86 systems would crash with a
misaligned access early in the build.
[GH #22577 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22577>]
.IP \(bu 4
Using \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR to tail call, or using the \fBcall_sv()\fR and related APIs to call,
any of \fBtrim()\fR, \fBrefaddr()\fR, \fBreftype()\fR, \fBceil()\fR, \fBfloor()\fR or \fBstringify()\fR in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`builtin::\*(C'\fR package would crash or assert due to a \f(CW\*(C`TARG\*(C'\fR handling bug.
[GH #22542 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22542>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed an issue where \f(CWutf8n_to_uvchr()\fR failed to correctly identify certain
invalid UTF\-8 sequences as invalid.  Specifically, sequences that start with
continuation bytes or unassigned bytes could cause unexpected behaviour or a
panic.  This fix ensures that such invalid sequences are now properly detected
and handled.  This correction also resolves related issues in modules that
handle UTF\-8 processing, such as Encode.
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a double free error or possible memory leak when failing to compile
certain regexps.  [GH #21661 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21661>]
