perl5418delta \- what is new for perl v5.41.8
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.41.7 release and the 5.41.8
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.6, first read
perl5417delta, which describes differences between 5.41.6 and 5.41.7.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Removed containing function references for functions without eval"
.IX Subsection "Removed containing function references for functions without eval"
Perl 5.40 reintroduced unconditional references from functions to their
containing functions to fix a bug introduced in Perl 5.18 that broke the
special behaviour of \f(CW\*(C`eval EXPR\*(C'\fR in package \f(CW\*(C`DB\*(C'\fR which is used by the
debugger.
.PP
In some cases this change led to circular reference chains between closures and
other existing references, resulting in memory leaks.
.PP
This change has been reverted, fixing
[GH #22547 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22547>] but re\-breaking
[GH #19370 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19370>].
.PP
This means the reference loops won\*(Aqt occur, and that lexical variables and
functions from enclosing functions may not be visible in the debugger.
.PP
Note that calling \f(CW\*(C`eval EXPR\*(C'\fR in a function unconditionally causes a function
to reference its enclosing functions as it always has.

The peephole optimizer recognises the following zero\-offset \f(CW\*(C`substr\*(C'\fR patterns
and swaps in a new dedicated operator (\f(CW\*(C`OP_SUBSTR_LEFT\*(C'\fR).

"shmread" in perlfunc and "shmwrite" in perlfunc are no longer limited to 31\-bit
values for their POS and SIZE arguments.
[GH #22895 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22895>]
.IP \(bu 4
"shmread" in perlfunc is now better behaved if VAR is not a plain string.  If VAR
is a tied variable, it calls \f(CW\*(C`STORE\*(C'\fR once; previously, it would also call
\&\f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR, but without using the result.  If VAR is a reference, the referenced
entity has its refcount properly decremented when VAR is turned into a string;
previously, it would leak memory.
