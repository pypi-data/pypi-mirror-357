.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.38.2 release and the 5.38.3
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.38.1, first read
perl5382delta, which describes differences between 5.38.1 and 5.38.2.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.38.2.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs"

.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`use 5.36;\*(C'\fR or later didn\*(Aqt enable the post parse reporting of Name "%s::%s"
used only once: possible typo warnings when enabling warnings.
[GH #21271 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21271>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a crash or assertion when cleaning up a closure that refers to an outside
\&\f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR sub.  [GH #21067 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21067>]
.IP \(bu 4
Don\*(Aqt clear the integer flag \f(CW\*(C`IOK\*(C'\fR from lines in the \f(CW\*(C`@{"_<$sourcefile"}\*(C'\fR
array when a \f(CW\*(C`dbstate\*(C'\fR op is removed for that line.  This was broken when
fixing [GH #19198 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19198>].
[GH #21564 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21564>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed an issue where \f(CWutf8n_to_uvchr()\fR failed to correctly identify certain
invalid UTF\-8 sequences as invalid.  Specifically, sequences that start with
continuation bytes or unassigned bytes could cause unexpected behaviour or a
panic.  This fix ensures that such invalid sequences are now properly detected
and handled.  This correction also resolves related issues in modules that
handle UTF\-8 processing, such as Encode.
.IP \(bu 4
Builds with \f(CW\*(C`\-msse\*(C'\fR and quadmath on 32\-bit x86 systems would crash with a
misaligned access early in the build.
[GH #22577 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22577>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a bug introduced in Perl 5.34 whereby uninitialized data in the
underlying array of an AV after it has been unshifted and resized could lead to
segmentation faults or other errors depending on the data.
[GH #21235 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21235>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed an issue where Perl sometimes failed to correctly toggle into a dot radix
locale.  [GH #21746 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21746>]
[GH #22176 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22176>]
.IP \(bu 4
Stopped certain syntax errors from provoking core dumps due to a double free of
an OP.  [GH #21724 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21724>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed a double free error or possible memory leak when failing to compile
certain regexps.  [GH #21661 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21661>]
.IP \(bu 4
Fixed the initialization of Perl\*(Aqs \fBquerylocale()\fR emulation so that the locale
is set correctly if the environment specifies a non\-C locale.
[GH #21366 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21366>]
