This document describes differences between the 5.41.2 release and the 5.41.3

.SS "Apostrophe is no longer recognized as a global name separator"
.IX Subsection "Apostrophe is no longer recognized as a global name separator"
The apostrophe \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR has been recognized as a separator between
components of package names and package variables since Perl 3, acting
exactly like \f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR, which was introduced in Perl 5.
.PP
Use of \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR as a package separator was deprecated in Perl 5.38 and has
now been removed.

.SS "Switch and Smart Match operator removed"
.IX Subsection "Switch and Smart Match operator removed"
The "switch" feature and the smartmatch operator, \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR, were introduced in
v5.10.  Their behavior was significantly changed in v5.10.1.  When the
"experiment" system was added in v5.18.0, switch and smartmatch were
retroactively declared experimental.  Over the years, proposals to fix or
supplement the features have come and gone.
.PP
They were deprecated in Perl v5.38.0 and scheduled for removal in Perl
5.42.0
.PP
These features have now been entirely removed.
.PP
If you code currently uses \f(CW\*(C`given\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`when\*(C'\fR or smart match this can be
replaced with an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR chain, or there are several alternative
"switch" or smart match implementations on CPAN.

but because \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR has higher precedence than \f(CW\*(C`isa\*(C'\fR, this is interpreted as
\&\f(CW\*(C`(!$obj) isa Some::Class\*(C'\fR, which checks whether a boolean is an instance of

.SH "Internal Changes"
.IX Header "Internal Changes"
.IP \(bu 4
When built with the \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUGGING\*(C'\fR compile option, perl API functions that
take pointers to distinct types of SVs (AVs, HVs or CVs) will check the
\&\f(CWSvTYPE()\fR of the passed values to ensure they are valid.  Additionally,
internal code within core functions that attempts to extract AVs, HVs or CVs
from reference values passed in will also perform such checks.
.Sp
While this has been entirely tested by normal Perl CI testing, there may
still be some corner\-cases where these constraints are violated in
otherwise\-valid calls.  These may require further investigation if they are
found, and specific code to be adjusted to account for it.

\&\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR automatically creates an anonymous temporary file when
passed \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as a filename:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(my $fh, "+>", undef) or die ...
.Ve
.Sp
Due to the way this feature was implemented, it would also trigger for
non\-existent elements of arrays or hashes:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    open(my $fh, "+>", $hash{no_such_key}) or die ...
\&    # unexpectedly succeeds and creates a temp file
.Ve
.Sp
Now a temporary file is only created if a literal \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is passed.

Compound assignment operators return lvalues that can be further modified:

\&    #  $x += $z;

.Sp
However, the separate numeric/string bitwise operators provided by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`bitwise\*(C'\fR feature, \f(CW\*(C`&= ^= |= &.= ^.= |.=\*(C'\fR,
did not do so:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    use feature qw(bitwise);
\&    ($x &= $y) += $z;
\&    # Used to die:
\&    #  Can\*(Aqt modify numeric bitwise and (&) in addition (+) at ...

Starting in v5.39.8, "\f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR" in POSIX would crash or produce odd errors

string that wasn\*(Aqt actually a string, but a number, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, or an object

Now \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR stringifies its first argument, as before.

.SH Obituary
.IX Header "Obituary"
Abe Timmerman (ABELTJE) passed away on August 15, 2024. Since 2002, Abe
built and maintained the Test::Smoke project: "a set of scripts and
modules that try to run the Perl core tests on as many configurations as
possible and combine the results into an easy to read report". Smoking
Perl on as many platforms and configurations as possible has been
instrumental in finding bugs and developing patches for those bugs.
.PP
Abe was a regular attendee of the Perl Toolchain Summit (née Perl QA
Hackathon), the Dutch Perl Workshop and the Amsterdam.pm user group
meetings. With his kindness, his smile and his laugh, he helped make
Perl and its community better.
