# Perl5

Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for text
manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system
administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and more.

This project provides python wheels for perl5. GNU make doesn't have builtin
support for cross compilation on macOS and Windows like xmake. So the wheels for
macOS on amd64 and Windows for arm64 are missing.

See [xmake-python](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-python#autotoolsmakefile).
