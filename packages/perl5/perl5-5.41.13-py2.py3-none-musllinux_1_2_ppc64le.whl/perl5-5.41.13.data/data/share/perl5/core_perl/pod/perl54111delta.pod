=head2 [CVE-2024-56406] Heap buffer overflow vulnerability with tr//

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.

When there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the C<tr> operator,
C<S_do_trans_invmap()> can overflow the destination pointer C<d>.

  $ perl -e '$_ = "\x{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\xFF/\x{100}/;'
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service or
Arbitrary Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.

Discovered by: Nathan Mills.

=item *

In some cases an C<eval> would not add integer parts to the source
lines saved by the debugger. [L<GH #23151|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23151>]

=item *

Save debugger lines as C<PVIV> SVs rather than as C<PVMG> SVs as they
don't need magic, aren't blessed and don't need to store a floating
point part.  This should save 24 bytes per stored line for 64-bit
systems, more for C<-Duselongdouble> or C<-Dusequadmath> builds.
Discussed in [L<GH #23171|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23171>].

=item *

Ensure cloning the save stack for fork emulation doesn't duplicate
freeing the RExC state. [L<GH #23022|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23022>]

=item *

Smartmatch against a code reference that uses a loop exit such as
C<last> would crash perl. [L<GH #16608|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16608>]

=item *

Class initializers and C<ADJUST> blocks, per L<perlclass>, that
called C<last> or other loop exits would crash perl.  Same cause as
for [L<GH #16608|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16608>].

=item *

Prevent a signature parameter of the form C<$ => from leaking an OP at
compile-time. [L<GH #23187|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23187>]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks
