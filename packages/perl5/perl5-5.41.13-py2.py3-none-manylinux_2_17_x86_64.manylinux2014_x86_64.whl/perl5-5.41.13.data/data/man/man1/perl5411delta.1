.SH NAME
perl5411delta \- what is new for perl v5.41.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.41.0 release and the 5.41.1
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.40.0, first read
perl5410delta, which describes differences between 5.40.0 and 5.41.0.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "More CORE:: subs"
.IX Subsection "More CORE:: subs"
\&\f(CW\*(C`chdir\*(C'\fR has been added as a subroutine to the CORE:: namespace.
.PP
Previously, code like \f(CW&CORE::chdir($dir)\fR or \f(CWmy $ref = \e&CORE::chdir;
$ref\->($dir)\fR would throw an error saying \f(CW\*(C`&CORE::chdir cannot be called
directly\*(C'\fR. These cases are now fully supported.
.SH "Performance Enhancements"
.IX Header "Performance Enhancements"
.IP \(bu 4
Constant\-folded strings are now sharable via the Copy\-on\-Write mechanism.
[GH #22163 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/22163>]
.Sp
The following code would previously have allocated eleven string buffers,
each containing one million "A"s:
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`my @scalars; push @scalars, ("A" x 1_000_000) for 0..9;\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Now a single buffer is allocated and shared between a CONST OP and
the ten scalar elements of \f(CW@scalars\fR.
.Sp
Note that any code using this sort of constant to simulate memory leaks
(perhaps in test files) must now permute the string in order to trigger
a string copy and the allocation of separate buffers. For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`("A" x 1_000_000).time\*(C'\fR might be a suitable small change.
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_leave_adjust_stacks\*(C'\fR: additional efficiency for mortal copies.

.SH Documentation
.IX Header "Documentation"

.IX Subsection "Changes to Existing Documentation"
We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.
.PP
Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:
.PP
\fIperlapi\fR
.IX Subsection "perlapi"
.IP \(bu 4
Combined the documentation for several groups of related functions
into single entries.
.PP
\fIperlfunc\fR
.IX Subsection "perlfunc"
.IP \(bu 4
Clarified the description of \f(CW\*(C`ref\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`reftype\*(C'\fR in relation
to built\-in types and class names.
.IP \(bu 4
Clarified that perl \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR is stable (and has been since v5.8.0).
.PP
\fIperlguts\fR
.IX Subsection "perlguts"
.IP \(bu 4
Added some description of "real" \f(CW\*(C`AV\*(C'\fRs compared to "fake" \f(CW\*(C`AV\*(C'\fRs.
.SH Testing
.IX Header "Testing"
Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
changes in this release.  Furthermore, these significant changes were
made:
.IP \(bu 4
A new \fIt/run/todo.t\fR test script was added as a place for TODO tests
for known unfixed bugs.
.SH "Internal Changes"
.IX Header "Internal Changes"
.IP \(bu 4
The "\f(CW\*(C`sv_strftime_ints\*(C'\fR" in perlapi function is introduced.  This is an
enhanced version of "\f(CW\*(C`my_strftime\*(C'\fR" in perlapi, which is retained for
backwards compatibility.  Both are to call \fBstrftime\fR\|(3) when you have
the year, month, hour, etc.  The new function handles UTF8ness for you,
and allows you to specify if you want the possibility of daylight
savings time to be considered.  \f(CW\*(C`my_strftime\*(C'\fR never considers DST.
.IP \(bu 4
The \f(CW\*(C`bytes_to_utf8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bytes_from_utf8\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`bytes_from_utf8_loc\*(C'\fR
functions are no longer experimental.
