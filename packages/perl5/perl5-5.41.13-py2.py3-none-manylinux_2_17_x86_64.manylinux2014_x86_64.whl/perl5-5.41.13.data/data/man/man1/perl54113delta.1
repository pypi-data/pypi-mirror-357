.IP \(bu 4
Exceptions thrown and caught entirely within a \f(CW\*(C`defer {}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`finally {}\*(C'\fR
block no longer stop the outer run\-loop.
.Sp
Code such as the following would stop running the contents of the \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR
block once the inner exception in the inner \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR block was caught.
This has now been fixed, and runs as expected. ([GH #23064 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23064>]).
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    defer {
\&        try { die "It breaks\en"; }

\&
\&        say "This line would never run";
\&    }
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
"readline" in perlfunc now clears the error flag if an error occurs when
reading and that error is \f(CW\*(C`EAGAIN\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`EWOULDBLOCK\*(C'\fR.  This allows
old code that depended on \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR to clear all errors to ignore
these relatively harmless errors.  [GH #22883 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22883>]
.IP \(bu 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR automatically creates an anonymous temporary file
when passed \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as a filename:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open(my $fh, "+>", undef) or die ...
.Ve
.Sp
This is supposed to work only when the undefined value is the one returned by
the \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
In perls before 5.41.3, this caused a problem due to the fact that the same
undefined value can be generated by lookups of non\-existent hash keys or array
elements, which can lead to bugs in user\-level code (reported as [GH #22385 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22385>]).
.Sp
In 5.41.3, additional checks based on the syntax tree of the call site were
added, which fixed this issue for some number of common cases, though not all
of them, at the cost of breaking the ability of APIs that wrap \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR to
expose its anonymous file mode. A notable example of such an API is autodie.
.Sp
This release reverts to the old problem in preference to the new one for the
time being.
