This document describes differences between the 5.41.6 release and the 5.41.7
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.5, first read
perl5416delta, which describes differences between 5.41.5 and 5.41.6.

.IX Subsection "New :writer attribute on field variables"
Classes defined using \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqclass\*(Aq\*(C'\fR are now able to automatically
create writer accessors for scalar fields, by using the \f(CW\*(C`:writer\*(C'\fR attribute,
similar to the way that \f(CW\*(C`:reader\*(C'\fR already creates reader accessors.
.PP

.el .SS "New \f(CWany\fP and \f(CWall\fP operators"
.IX Subsection "New any and all operators"
A new experimental feature has been added, which adds two new list\-processing
operators, \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 2

\&        say "All the numbers are even";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
These operate similarly to \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR except that they only ever return true or
false, testing if any (or all) of the elements in the list make the testing
block yield true.  Because of this they can short\-circuit, avoiding the need
to test any further elements if a given element determines the eventual
result.
.PP
These are inspired by the same\-named functions in the List::Util module,
except that they are implemented as direct core operators, and thus perform
faster, and do not produce an additional subroutine call stack frame for
invoking the code block.
.SH "Performance Enhancements"
.IX Header "Performance Enhancements"
.IP \(bu 4
Code that uses the \f(CW\*(C`indexed\*(C'\fR function from the builtin module to generate
a list of index/value pairs out of an array or list which is then passed into
a two\-variable \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR list to unpack those again is now optimised to be
more efficient.
.Sp
.Vb 1

In particular, a temporary list twice the size of the original is no longer
generated.  Instead, the loop iterates down the original array or list
in\-place directly, in the same way that \f(CW\*(C`foreach (@array)\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`foreach (LIST)\*(C'\fR would do.

.SH "Configuration and Compilation"
.IX Header "Configuration and Compilation"
.IP \(bu 4
The (mostly undocumented) configuration macro \f(CW\*(C`PERL_STRICT_CR\*(C'\fR has been
removed. When enabled (e.g. with \f(CW\*(C`./Configure \-A ccflags=\-DPERL_STRICT_CR\*(C'\fR),
it would make the perl parser throw a fatal error when it encountered a CR
(carriage return) character in source files. The default (and now only)
behavior of the perl parser is to strip CRs paired with newline characters and
otherwise treat them as whitespace.
.Sp
(\f(CW\*(C`PERL_STRICT_CR\*(C'\fR was originally introduced in perl 5.005 to optionally
restore backward compatibility with perl 5.004, which had made CR in source
files an error. Before that, CR was accepted, but retained literally in quoted
multi\-line constructs such as here\-documents, even at the end of a line.)
.IP \(bu 4
Similarly, the (even less documented) configuration macro \f(CW\*(C`PERL_CR_FILTER\*(C'\fR has
been removed. When enabled, it would install a default source filter to strip
carriage returns from source code before the parser proper got to see it.

.SH "Internal Changes"

.IP \(bu 4
New API functions are introduced to convert strings encoded in UTF\-8 to
their ordinal code point equivalent.  These are safe to use by default,
and generally more convenient to use than the existing ones.
.Sp
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi and "\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv_or_die\*(C'\fR" in perlapi replace
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uvchr\*(C'\fR" in perlapi (which is retained for backwards
compatibility), but you should convert to use the new forms, as likely
you aren\*(Aqt using the old one safely.
.Sp
To convert in the opposite direction, you can now use
"\f(CW\*(C`uv_to_utf8\*(C'\fR" in perlapi.  This is not a new function, but a new synonym
for "\f(CW\*(C`uvchr_to_utf8\*(C'\fR" in perlapi.  It is added so you don\*(Aqt have to learn
two sets of names.
.Sp
There are also two new functions, "\f(CW\*(C`strict_utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi and
"\f(CW\*(C`c9strict_utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi which do the same thing except when
the input string represents a code point that Unicode doesn\*(Aqt accept as
legal for interchange, using either the strict original definition
(\f(CW\*(C`strict_utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR), or the looser one given by
Unicode Corrigendum #9 <https://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>
(\f(CW\*(C`c9strict_utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR).  When the input string represents one of the
restricted code points, these functions return the Unicode
\&\f(CW\*(C`REPLACEMENT CHARACTER\*(C'\fR instead.
.Sp
Also "\f(CW\*(C`extended_utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi is a synonym for \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv\*(C'\fR, for use
when you want to emphasize that the entire range of Perl extended UTF\-8
is acceptable.
.Sp
There are also replacement functions for the three more specialized
conversion functions that you are unlikely to need to use.  Again, the
old forms are kept for backwards compatibility, but you should convert
to use the new forms.
.Sp
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv_flags\*(C'\fR" in perlapi replaces "\f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvchr\*(C'\fR" in perlapi.
.Sp
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv_errors\*(C'\fR" in perlapi replaces "\f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvchr_error\*(C'\fR" in perlapi.
.Sp
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_uv_msgs\*(C'\fR" in perlapi replaces
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs\*(C'\fR" in perlapi.
.Sp
Also added are the inverse functions "\f(CW\*(C`uv_to_utf8_flags\*(C'\fR" in perlapi
and "\f(CW\*(C`uv_to_utf8_msgs\*(C'\fR" in perlapi, which are synonyms for the existing
functions, "\f(CW\*(C`uvchr_to_utf8_flags\*(C'\fR" in perlapi and
"\f(CW\*(C`uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs\*(C'\fR" in perlapi respectively.  These are provided only
so you don\*(Aqt have to learn two sets of names.
.IP \(bu 4
Three new API functions are introduced to convert strings encoded in
UTF\-8 to native bytes format (if possible).  These are easier to use
than the existing ones, and they avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
The functions are "\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_bytes_overwrite\*(C'\fR" in perlapi which is used
when it is ok for the input string to be overwritten with the converted
result; and "\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_bytes_new_pv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi and
"\f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_bytes_temp_pv\*(C'\fR" in perlapi when the original string must be
preserved intact.  \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_bytes_temp_pv\*(C'\fR returns the result in a
temporary using perlapi/\f(CW\*(C`SAVEFREEPV\*(C'\fR that will automatically be
destroyed.  With \f(CW\*(C`utf8_to_bytes_new_pv\*(C'\fR, you are responsible for
freeing the newly allocated memory that is returned if the conversion is
successful.
.Sp
The latter two functions are designed to replace
"\f(CW\*(C`bytes_from_utf8\*(C'\fR" in perlapi which creates memory unnecessarily, or
unnecessarily large.
.IP \(bu 4
New API functions \f(CWvalid_identifier_pve()\fR,
\&\f(CWvalid_identifier_pvn()\fR and
\&\f(CWvalid_identifier_sv()\fR have been added, which
test if a string would be considered by Perl to be a valid identifier name.
.IP \(bu 4
When assigning from an SVt_IV into a SVt_NV (or vice versa), providing that
both are "bodyless" types, Perl_sv_setsv_flags will now just change the
destination type to match the source type. Previously, an SVt_IV would have
been upgraded to a SVt_PVNV to store an NV, and an SVt_NV would have been
upgraded to a SVt_PVIV to store an IV. This change prevents the need to
allocate \- and later free \- the relevant body struct.
