perl5412delta \- what is new for perl v5.41.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.41.1 release and the 5.41.2
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.0, first read
perl5411delta, which describes differences between 5.41.0 and 5.41.1.

.ie n .SS "New pragma ""source::encoding"""
.el .SS "New pragma \f(CWsource::encoding\fP"
.IX Subsection "New pragma source::encoding"
This allows you to declare that the portion of a program for the
remainder of the lexical scope of this pragma is encoded either entirely
in ASCII (for \f(CW\*(C`use\ source::encoding\ \*(Aqascii\*(Aq\*(C'\fR) or if UTF\-8 is allowed
as well (for \f(CW\*(C`use\ source::encoding\ \*(Aqutf8\*(Aq\*(C'\fR). No other encodings are
accepted. The second form is entirely equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`use\ utf8\*(C'\fR, and
may be used interchangeably with that.
.PP
The purpose of this pragma is to catch cases early where you forgot to
specify \f(CW\*(C`use\ utf8\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\ source::encoding\ \*(Aqascii\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is automatically enabled within the
lexical scope of a \f(CW\*(C`use\ v5.41.0\*(C'\fR or higher.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no\ source::encoding\*(C'\fR turns off all this checking for the remainder of
its lexical scope. The meaning of non\-ASCII characters is then undefined.
