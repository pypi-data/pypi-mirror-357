perl5416delta \- what is new for perl v5.41.6
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.41.5 release and the 5.41.6
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.4, first read
perl5415delta, which describes differences between 5.41.4 and 5.41.5.
.SH "Performance Enhancements"
.IX Header "Performance Enhancements"
.IP \(bu 4
Code that uses the \f(CW\*(C`indexed\*(C'\fR function from the builtin module to generate
a list of index/value pairs out of array which is then passed into a
two\-variable \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR list to unpack those again is now optimised to be more
efficient.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my @array = (...);
\&
\&    foreach my ($idx, $val) (builtin::indexed @array) {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
In particular, a temporary list twice the size of the original
array is no longer generated.  Instead, the list iterates down the array
in\-place directly, in the same way that \f(CW\*(C`foreach (@array)\*(C'\fR would do.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

.SS "Apostrophe is again recognized as a global name separator"
.IX Subsection "Apostrophe is again recognized as a global name separator"
This was deprecated in Perl 5.38 and removed as scheduled in perl
5.41.3, but after some discussion has been reinstated by default.
.PP
This can be controlled with the \f(CW\*(C`apostrophe_as_package_separator\*(C'\fR
feature which is enabled by default, but is disabled from the 5.41
feature bundle onwards.
.PP
If you want to disable use within your own code you can explicitly
disable the feature:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  no feature "apostrophe_as_package_separator";
.Ve
.PP
Note that disabling this feature only prevents use of apostrophe as a
package separator within code; symbolic references still treat \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR as
\&\f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR with the feature disabled:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my $symref = "My\*(AqModule\*(AqVar";
\&  # default features
\&  my $x = $My\*(AqModule\*(AqVar; # fine
\&  no feature "apostrophe_as_package_separator";
\&  no strict "refs";
\&  my $y = $$symref;       # like $My::Module::Var
\&  my $z = $My\*(AqModule\*(AqVar; # syntax error

The perl parser would erroneously parse like \f(CW\*(C`=cut\*(C'\fR some other POD directives
whose names start with \fIcut\fR, prematurely terminating an embedded POD section.
The following cases were affected: \fIcut\fR followed by a digit (e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`=cut2studio\*(C'\fR), \fIcut\fR followed by an underscore (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`=cut_grass\*(C'\fR), and in

\&\f(CW\*(C`cygwin\*(C'\fR builds may fail during testing due to a conflict between the
load addresses of \fIcygperl5_41_6.dll\fR and
\&\fIolib/auto/I18N/Langinfo/Langinfo.dll\fR.  This will also be visible
for anything that attempts to \fBfork()\fR with \f(CW\*(C`I18N::LangInfo\*(C'\fR loaded.
.Sp
This is known to fail for builds with options that increase the size
of the binary, such as \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUGGING\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-Doptimize="\-O0 \-g"\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Doptimize="\-O2 \-g \-march=x86\-64\-v2"\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This can be avoided by building perl with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Astatic_ext=I18N/Langinfo\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The base addresses are generated by the linker based on the names of
the DLLs, so this is expected to clear up for 5.41.7.
