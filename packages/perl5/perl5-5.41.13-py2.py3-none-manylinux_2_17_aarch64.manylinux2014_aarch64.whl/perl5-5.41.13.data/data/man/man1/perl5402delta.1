perl5402delta \- what is new for perl v5.40.2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.40.1 release and the 5.40.2
release.
.PP

perl5401delta, which describes differences between 5.40.0 and 5.40.1.
.SH Security
.IX Header "Security"
.SS "[CVE\-2024\-56406] Heap buffer overflow vulnerability with tr//"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2024-56406] Heap buffer overflow vulnerability with tr//"
A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.
.PP
When there are non\-ASCII bytes in the left\-hand\-side of the \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR operator,
\&\f(CWS_do_trans_invmap()\fR can overflow the destination pointer \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $ perl \-e \*(Aq$_ = "\ex{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\exFF/\ex{100}/;\*(Aq
\&  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
.Ve
.PP
It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service or
Arbitrary Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.
.PP
Discovered by: Nathan Mills.

from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl\*(Aqs core.  We\*(Aqre grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
