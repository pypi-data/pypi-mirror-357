perl54112delta - what is new for perl v5.41.12

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.41.11 release and the 5.41.12
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.10, first read
L<perl54111delta>, which describes differences between 5.41.10 and 5.41.11.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

This release contains one fix, which only affects the darwin architecture (macos),
where F<hints/darwin.sh> contained a syntax error that caused the installation to fail.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item MacOS (Darwin)

As in release 5.41.11, collation of strings using locales on MacOS 15 (Darwin
24) and up has been turned off due to a failed assertion in its libc.

If earlier versions are also experiencing issues (such as failures in
F<locale.t>), you can explicitly disable locale collation by adding the
C<-Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE> option to your invocation of C<./Configure>,
or just C<-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE> to the C<ccflags> and C<cppflags>
variables in F<config.sh>.
