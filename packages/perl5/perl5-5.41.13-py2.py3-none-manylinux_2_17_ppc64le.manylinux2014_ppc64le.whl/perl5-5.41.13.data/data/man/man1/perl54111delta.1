.SS "[CVE\-2024\-56406] Heap buffer overflow vulnerability with tr//"
.IX Subsection "[CVE-2024-56406] Heap buffer overflow vulnerability with tr//"
A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.
.PP
When there are non\-ASCII bytes in the left\-hand\-side of the \f(CW\*(C`tr\*(C'\fR operator,
\&\f(CWS_do_trans_invmap()\fR can overflow the destination pointer \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR.

\&  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
.Ve
.PP
It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service or
Arbitrary Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.

.IP \(bu 4
In some cases an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR would not add integer parts to the source
lines saved by the debugger. [GH #23151 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23151>]
.IP \(bu 4
Save debugger lines as \f(CW\*(C`PVIV\*(C'\fR SVs rather than as \f(CW\*(C`PVMG\*(C'\fR SVs as they
don\*(Aqt need magic, aren\*(Aqt blessed and don\*(Aqt need to store a floating
point part.  This should save 24 bytes per stored line for 64\-bit
systems, more for \f(CW\*(C`\-Duselongdouble\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-Dusequadmath\*(C'\fR builds.
Discussed in [GH #23171 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23171>].

freeing the RExC state. [GH #23022 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23022>]

Smartmatch against a code reference that uses a loop exit such as

.IP \(bu 4
Class initializers and \f(CW\*(C`ADJUST\*(C'\fR blocks, per perlclass, that
called \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR or other loop exits would crash perl.  Same cause as
