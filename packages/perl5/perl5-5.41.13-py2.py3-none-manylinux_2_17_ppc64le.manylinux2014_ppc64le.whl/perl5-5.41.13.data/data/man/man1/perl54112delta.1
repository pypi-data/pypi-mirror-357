.SH NAME
perl54112delta \- what is new for perl v5.41.12
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.41.11 release and the 5.41.12
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.10, first read
perl54111delta, which describes differences between 5.41.10 and 5.41.11.
.SH "Configuration and Compilation"
.IX Header "Configuration and Compilation"
This release contains one fix, which only affects the darwin architecture (macos),
where \fIhints/darwin.sh\fR contained a syntax error that caused the installation to fail.
.SS "Platform\-Specific Notes"
.IX Subsection "Platform-Specific Notes"
.IP "MacOS (Darwin)" 4
.IX Item "MacOS (Darwin)"
As in release 5.41.11, collation of strings using locales on MacOS 15 (Darwin
24) and up has been turned off due to a failed assertion in its libc.
.Sp
If earlier versions are also experiencing issues (such as failures in
\&\fIlocale.t\fR), you can explicitly disable locale collation by adding the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Accflags=\-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE\*(C'\fR option to your invocation of \f(CW\*(C`./Configure\*(C'\fR,
or just \f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE\*(C'\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`ccflags\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`cppflags\*(C'\fR
variables in \fIconfig.sh\fR.
