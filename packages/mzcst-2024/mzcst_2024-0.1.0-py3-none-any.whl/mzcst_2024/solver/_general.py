        Layer (str):
            `Layer (int numLayers)`.
            Specifies the number of PML layers. Usually 4 layers are sufficient.
        MinimumLinesDistance (str):
            `MinimumLinesDistance (double value)`.
            Specifies the minimum distance from the PML boundary to the
            structure to be modeled. The distance is determined by the absolute
            number of grid lines.
        MinimumDistanceType (str):
            `MinimumDistanceReferenceFrequencyType (enum {"Center", "Centernmonitors", "User"} type)`.
            Selecting the Fraction option activates the geometrical domain
            enlargement computed as a fraction of the wavelength. With the
            Absolute option the distance is directly given in geometrical user
            units. To this purpose use the SetAbsoluteDistance command.
        SetAbsoluteDistance  (str):
            `SetAbsoluteDistance (double value)`.
            Specifies the absolute distance to enlarge the simulation domain.
            To be used selecting the Absolute option with the command
            `MinimumDistanceType`.
        MinimumDistanceReferenceFrequencyType (str):
            `MinimumDistanceReferenceFrequencyType (enum {"Center", "Centernmonitors", "User"} type)`.
            The command determines the reference frequency where the wavelength
            has to be computed. The command should be used jointly with the
            MinimumDistanceType command activating the Fraction option.
            `"Center"` means that the reference frequency is the mid simulation
            frequency, in formula (FMin+FMax)/2.
            The second choice `"Centernmonitors"` computes the reference frequency
            as the minimum non zero frequency selected among the center
            frequency and the user defined relevant  monitor frequencies.
            The third possibility is `"User"`, which enables to specify directly
            the frequency with the companion FrequencyForMinimumDistance command.
        MinimumDistancePerWavelength (str):
            `MinimumDistancePerWavelength (double value)`.
            Specifies the minimum distance from the PML boundary to the
            structure to be modeled. The distance is determined relatively to
            the wavelength, either in respect to the center frequency, center
            and monitor frequencies or to a user defined frequency value. See
            also the `MinimumDistanceReferenceFrequencyType` command.
        FrequencyForMinimumDistance (str):
            `FrequencyForMinimumDistance (double value)`.
            Specifies the frequency which represents the reference value for the
            `MinimumDistancePerWavelength` method.

        XPeriodicShift (float):
            `XPeriodicShift (double value)`.
            Enables to define a phase shift value for a periodic boundary
            condition. Please note that the phase shift only applies to the
            frequency domain solver and the eigenmode solver. The settings are
            ignored by the transient solver.
        YPeriodicShift (float): see `XPeriodicShift`.
        ZPeriodicShift (float): see `XPeriodicShift`.

        PeriodicUseConstantAngles (bool):
            `PeriodicUseConstantAngles (bool bFlag)`
            In contrast to the definition of a constant phase shift between two
            opposite periodic boundaries (using the `XPeriodicShift`,
            `YPeriodicShift` or `ZPeriodicShift` methods) it is also possible to
            define an incident angle value of the normal propagation direction
            of a virtual plane wave entering the calculation domain. The angle
            can be defined in a spherical coordinate system using the
            `SetPeriodicBoundaryAngles` method. In fact this procedure also
            realizes a phase shift between the periodic boundaries, however,
            this time it depends on the current frequency sample. You can
            activate (bFlag = True) or deactivate (bFlag = False) this option
            using the present method.

        SetPeriodicBoundaryAngles (str):
            `SetPeriodicBoundaryAngles (double theta, double phi)`
            Defines the angle in a spherical coordinate system using theta and
            phi values for the calculation of phase shifts between periodic
            boundaries. The z-axis corresponds to that of the global coordinate
            system.

            Please note that this method is only relevant for the frequency
            domain solver and in case that the `PeriodicUseConstantAngles`
            method is activated or unit cell boundaries are used.
        SetPeriodicBoundaryAnglesDirection (str):
            `SetPeriodicBoundaryAnglesDirection (enum direction)`.
            `direction` defines whether the scan angle defined with
            `SetPeriodicBoundaryAngles` refers to an inward or outward (with
            respect to the radial unit vector in the spherical coordinate
            system) propagating plane wave, and can have one of the following
            values ->
            `”outward”` The phase is set for an outward traveling plane wave.
            Floquet modes should be excited at Zmin.
            `”inward”` The phase is set for an inward traveling plane wave.
            Floquet modes should be excited at Zmax.


        UnitCellDs1 (str):
            `UnitCellDs1 (double value)`.
            These two methods specify the distances between two neighboring unit
            cells in two different coordinate directions, whereby the first axis
            (UnitCellDs1) is always aligned to the x-axis of the global
            coordinate system. The spatial relation between these two axes is
            defined by the `UnitCellAngle` method.
        UnitCellDs2 (str): see `UnitCellDs1`.

        UnitCellAngle (str):
            `UnitCellAngle (double value)`.
            Specifies the spatial relation between the two axes defined by the
            methods `UnitCellDs1` and `UnitCellDs2`.
            Please note, that the hexahedral frequency domain solver needs a
            value of 90 degree for this value.
        UnitCellOrigin (str):
            `UnitCellOrigin  ( double posx, double posy )`.
            Allows to shift the origin of the unit cell and thereby the
            calculation domain for the frequency domain solver with tetrahedral
            mesh. The values may range from zero to one, where the default zero
            lets the center of the bounding box and the center of the unit cell
            coincide, while a value of one moves the origin by half the size of
            the unit cell lattice in the corresponding direction.
        UnitCellFitToBoundingBox (str):
            `UnitCellFitToBoundingBox  ( bool bFlag )`.
            If this method is activated, the structure model will be repeated at
            its bounding box borders, neglecting any settings of the methods
            `UnitCellDs1`, `UnitCellDs2` and `UnitCellAngle`.

    Please note that this advanced interface requires ADS 2005A or above and 
    needs CST Microwave Studio and ADS being installed on the same computer. CST 
    Microwave Studio manages an ADS Design Kit which contains a dynamically 
    extended list of EM simulation components. Once the ADS Design Kit is 
    installed, the library based on CST Microwave Studio models will be 
    accessible through the ADS library browser.

    For more detailed information about this and the installation of the ADS 
    Design Kit please refer to the CST Studio Suite - Getting Started manual or 
    the ADS documentation which is located in the CST Microwave Studio global 
    macro directory in the subfolder "ADS\\DesignKit".
