""" 提供与`cst.radar.channel_tensor`交互的接口。

This module provides a convenient way of representing F/S parameters from a simulation in a compact form. The ChannelTensor object is created from simulation data and facilitates a convenient data representation. Several methods to extract data from a CST Asymptotic solver simulation are provided.
