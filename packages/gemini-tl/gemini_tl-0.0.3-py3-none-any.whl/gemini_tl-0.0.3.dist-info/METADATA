# Gemini TL: AI-Powered Subtitle Generation with Translation

> Generate and translate English and Japanese subtitles using Google Gemini AI.

## Project Overview
Gemini TL is a powerful tool that leverages the Google Gemini API to generate and translate subtitles for videos. While primarily tested and designed for transcribing and translating Japanese content from sources like Hololive concert videos into both English and Japanese subtitles, it is also capable of processing other video types.

## Gemini TL Features and Considerations

### Advantages of Gemini TL:
*   **Multimodal Context:** Gemini's advanced multimodal capabilities enable it to analyze video content comprehensively, including on-screen text, for superior contextual understanding and more accurate subtitle generation.
*   **On-screen Lyric Handling:** Demonstrates exceptional performance in generating precise subtitles for singing portions with on-screen lyrics.
*   **Cloud-Based Processing:** All processing is efficiently handled on Google's robust Gemini infrastructure, eliminating the need for local GPUs or extensive computational resources on your machine.

### Considerations:
*   **Timestamp Precision:** Subtitle timestamps may exhibit a minor offset of a few seconds.
*   **Network Usage:** Uploading entire video files to Google's services will consume network bandwidth.

## How Gemini TL Works
*   **Video Segmentation:** The input video is automatically segmented into 180-second segments. This duration is configurable via the `--split_seconds` flag.
*   **Concurrent Processing:** Each video segment is then sent to Google Gemini for subtitle generation. You can adjust the number of concurrent processing threads using the `--num_processing_threads` flag to optimize performance.
*   **Subtitle Compilation:** All generated subtitle parts are seamlessly combined into a single, comprehensive subtitle file.

## Getting Started: A Quick Guide

### 1. Obtain Your Google Gemini API Key
Follow these simple steps to acquire your API key:
1.  Sign in to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Click "Create API Key."
3.  Copy and securely store your API key. **Never disclose your API key publicly.**

### 2. Set Up Your Python Environment (Python 3.10+ Required)
Prepare your python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
pip install --upgrade gemini-tl
```

### 3. Execute the Script
Run the application with your video file:
```bash
gemini-tl --api_key=YOUR_API_KEY "path/to/your/video.mp4"
```
**Note**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google Gemini API key and `"path/to/your/video.mp4"` with the full path to your video file.

## Known Limitations of Gemini AI

1.  **Timestamp Accuracy:** Subtitle timestamps may exhibit inaccuracies. This is an inherent characteristic of the Gemini model.
    *   Observations indicate that shorter video segments generally lead to improved timestamp accuracy.
    *   Requesting second-level precision for timestamps generally yields more accurate results compared to millisecond-level precision from the model. Consequently, the current implementation is designed to request second-level timestamps.

2.  **AI Hallucinations:** Like all AI models, Gemini may occasionally produce "hallucinations" or inaccurate information. This is a known characteristic of current AI technology.

If you encounter issues related to these limitations, consider re-processing specific video segments as detailed in the "Re-processing Specific Video Segments" section below.

## Re-processing Specific Video Segments
Intermediate files generated during processing are stored in the temporary directory, which defaults to `tmp_<input_file_name>` but can be specified using the `--temp_dir` CLI flag. Users can examine these `part_XXX.json` files within this directory to review the AI's results for individual segments. To re-process a specific video segment, simply delete its corresponding `part_XXX.json` file. Upon subsequent execution, the script will automatically re-process only those segments for which the `part_XXX.json` file is absent.
