    Default implementations in :meth:`Variator.vary_population`
    and :meth:`Evaluator.evaluate_population` use this method.

    .. warning::
        Consider installing `multiprocess` (by the author
        of `dill`) if you run into any trouble with multiprocessing.

        Do not give :class:`multiprocessing.pool.Pool`
        in :arg:`processes`. Instead, consider using either
        an integer, or a :class:`multiprocess.pool.Pool`, or
        a :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.

        The :mod:`multiprocessing` module, which is part of the
        standard library, uses pickle. This means a `self`,
        which contains lambdas, complex objects, and most
        complex objects created in a Jupyter notebook,
        would crash worker processes. This is impossible
        to detect and correct in :class:`multiprocessing.pool.Pool`
        because it would attempt to restart crashed
        workers, which leads to indefinite hanging.

        Correcting this would require a significant
        investment in time and diving quite deep into the
        Python source code. This is beyond the Developer's
        capabilities.

    Args:
        fn: Task to be parallelised.

        self: The caller, which might be shared by worker
            processes if :arg:`share_self` is :python:`True`.

        iterable: Data to be processed in parallel.

        processes: Option that decides how may processes to use.
            Can be an :class:`int`, a :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor`,
            or :python:`None`.

            * If :arg:`processes` is an :class:`int`: create a new
              :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor` with :arg:`processes` workers,
              then use it to execute the task. On Windows, it must be at
              most 61.

            * If :arg:`processes` is a :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor`:
              use it to execute the task.

            * If (by default) ``processes==None``:
              Do not parallelise.

            To use all available processors, set :arg:`processes`
            to :meth:`os.process_cpu_count`.

        share_self: If :python:`True`, share a deep copy
            of ``self`` to each worker process.
            Non-serialisable attributes are replaced with
            :python:`None` instead.

            If :arg:`processes` is :python:`None`, then this argument has
            no effect.
