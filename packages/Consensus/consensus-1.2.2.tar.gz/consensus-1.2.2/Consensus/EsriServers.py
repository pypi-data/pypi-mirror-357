class OpenGeography(EsriConnector):
    """
    Open Geography Portal
    ---------------------

    This module provides a class ``OpenGeography()`` that connects to the Open Geography Portal API.

    Running ``OpenGeography().build_lookup()`` is necessary if you want to make use of the ``SmartLinker()`` class from the GeocodeMerger module.

    Usage:
    ------
    This module works in the same way as the ``EsriConnector()`` class, but it is specifically designed for the Open Geography Portal API. It relies on ``build_lookup()`` method that creates a lookup table for the portal's FeatureServers and saves it to a JSON file.

    .. code-block:: python

        from Consensus.EsriServers import OpenGeography
        import asyncio

        async def build_ogp_lookup()
            og = OpenGeography()
            await og.build_lookup()

        asyncio.run(build_ogp_lookup())


    As with any ``EsriConnector()`` sub-class, you can combine ``OpenGeography()`` with the ``FeatureServer()`` class to download data from the portal's FeatureServers.

    .. code-block:: python

        from Consensus.EsriConnector import FeatureServer
        from Consensus.EsriServers import OpenGeography
        from Consensus.utils import where_clause_maker
        import asyncio

        async def download_test_data():
            og = OpenGeography(max_retries=30, retry_delay=2)

            fs = FeatureServer()

            column_name = 'WD23NM'
            geographic_areas = ['Brockley']
            service_name = 'Wards_December_2023_Boundaries_UK_BSC'
            layers = og.select_layers_by_service(service_name=service_name)  # choose the first layer of the 'Wards_December_2023_Boundaries_UK_BSC' service
            layer_full_name = layers[0].full_name  # use the layer's ``full_name`` attribute to select it in ``fs.setup()``

            where_clause = where_clause_maker(values=geographic_areas, column=column_name)  # a helper function that creates the SQL where clause for Esri Servers

            await fs.setup(full_name=layer_full_name, esri_server=og._name, max_retries=30, retry_delay=2, chunk_size=50)
            output = await fs.download(where_clause=where_clause, return_geometry=True)
            print(output)

        asyncio.run(download_test_data())


    However, it is perhaps best to rely on the ``GeocodeMerger.SmartLinker()`` class for more complex downloads from the Open Geography Portal.

class TFL(EsriConnector):
    """
    TFL
    ---

    This module contains the TFL class, which is a subclass of ``EsriConnector()``. It is used to connect to the TfL Open Data Hub and retrieve data.

    Usage:
    ------

    .. code-block:: python

        from Consensus.EsriServers import TFL

        tfl = TFL(max_retries=30, retry_delay=2)
        tfl.print_all_services()  # a method to help you choose which service you'd like to download data for.

    The above code will connect to the TfL Open Data Hub and print all available services. You select the service you want to connect to by copying the service name string that comes after "Service name:" in the output.

    Let's say you want to view the bus stops data and explore the metadata:

    .. code-block:: python

        from Consensus.EsriServers import TFL
        import asyncio

        async def minimal():
            tfl = TFL(max_retries=30, retry_delay=2)
            metadata = await tfl.metadata_as_pandas(included_services=['Bus_Stops'])
            print(metadata)

        asyncio.run(minimal())

    This will connect to the TfL Open Data Hub and retrieve all available data for Bus_Stops service. From here, you can create a `where` clause to further fine-tune your query:

    .. code-block:: python

        from Consensus.EsriServers import TFL
        from Consensus.utils import where_clause_maker
        import asyncio

        async def download_test_data():
            tfl = TFL(max_retries=30, retry_delay=2)

            fs = FeatureServer()

            service_name = 'Bus_Stops'
            layers = tfl.select_layers_by_service(service_name=service_name)  # choose the first layer of the 'Bus_Stops' service
            layer_full_name = layers[0].full_name  # use the layer's ``full_name`` attribute to select it in ``fs.setup()`` and when creating the ``where_clause``


            column_name = 'STOP_NAME'
            geographic_areas = ['Hazel Mead']
            where_clause = where_clause_maker(values=geographic_areas, column=column_name)  # a helper function that creates the SQL where clause for Esri Servers

            await fs.setup(full_name=layer_full_name, esri_server=tfl._name, max_retries=30, retry_delay=2, chunk_size=50)
            output = await fs.download(where_clause=where_clause, return_geometry=True)
