## Overview
- MatrixGen is a modular Python package for generating, resizing, and analyzing sparse matrices. It supports multiple synthesis methods and provides tools for structure-aware scaling, useful in scientific computing, numerical simulations, and ML workloads where realistic matrix patterns are essential.

## Features

- **Modular Sparse Matrix Generation**
Generate structurally realistic sparse matrices of arbitrary size from a given base matrix using a unified and extensible framework.

- **Multiple Scaling Techniques**
Includes support for adapted resizing methods such as:

    - Nearest Neighbor

    - Bilinear Interpolation

    - Lanczos Resampling

    - Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

    - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

    - Wavelet Transforms

- **Preservation of Structure and Sparsity**
Each method is designed to maintain key structural properties including sparsity patterns, symmetry, and bandwidth.

- **Controlled Randomization**
Allows slight variations during generation to support realistic data augmentation while retaining essential characteristics.

- **Feature-Based Evaluation**
Measures similarity between original and synthetic matrices using structural features like:

    - Nonzero density

    - Bandwidth and profile

    - Symmetry (Psym)

    - Diagonal spread and entropy

    - Row/column distribution metrics

    Cosine similarity is used to quantify structural preservation.

- **Scalable Generation**
Capable of generating matrices at much larger scales than the input while preserving core traits â€” useful for performance benchmarking and large-scale ML testing.

- **Fills a Sparse Matrix Data Gap**
Addresses the lack of diverse, realistic sparse matrices for algorithm validation, benchmarking, and ML applications.

## Requirements

- Handled automatically via Poetry. Requires Python 3.11 or higher.

This project is based off of [MatrixGen-d](https://github.com/He-Is-HaZaRdOuS/matrixgen-d) which in itself is a fork of the original [MatrixGen](https://github.com/aliemrepmk/MatrixGen---A-Realistic-Sparse-Matrix-Generator) by [Ali Emre Pamuk](https://github.com/aliemrepmk), [Mert Altekin](https://github.com/AltekinMert), and [Faruk Kaplan](https://github.com/farukaplan). They are the original creators of the matrix synthesis/generation/resizing logic and without them, this project wouldn't exist.
