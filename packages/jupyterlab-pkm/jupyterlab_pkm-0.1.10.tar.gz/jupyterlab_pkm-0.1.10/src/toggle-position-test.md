# Toggle Button Position Test

## ✅ Button Moved to Left Pane

The edit/preview toggle button has been moved from the bottom center to the bottom of the left pane to prevent it from occluding the autocomplete dropdown.

### Changes Made:

**Before** - `src/markdown-preview.ts:49-61`
```css
position: fixed;
bottom: 20px;
left: 50%;                    /* Center horizontally */
transform: translateX(-50%);  /* Center alignment */
```

**After** - `src/markdown-preview.ts:49-61`
```css
position: fixed;
bottom: 20px;
left: 20px;                   /* Left side positioning */
width: calc(var(--jp-sidebar-min-width, 240px) - 40px);
max-width: 280px;             /* Fits in left pane */
```

### Layout Changes:

- **Positioning**: Moved from bottom center to bottom left
- **Width**: Now fits within left sidebar width
- **Layout**: Changed from horizontal to vertical stacking for better fit
- **Text size**: Slightly reduced for compact display

### Test Instructions:

1. **Open this file** in edit mode
2. **Notice the toggle button** is now in the left pane
3. **Type `[[` anywhere** - autocomplete dropdown should appear without occlusion
4. **Test in various positions** - especially near bottom of document

Test autocomplete here without button interference:

[[

This should work perfectly now with no visual interference from the toggle button!

## Expected Behavior:

✅ Toggle button stays in left pane
✅ Autocomplete dropdown appears in main editor area
✅ No overlap or occlusion issues
✅ Both features work independently
