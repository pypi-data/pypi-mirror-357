# ZoneFinder

## Description

`zonefinder` is a Python package designed to identify and analyze key support and resistance price levels 
from financial market data 📈

It provides tools to detect the most frequent highs, lows, and closes, as well as to cluster these price points into support and resistance zones 🔎

## Installation

You can install `zonefinder` via pip:

```bash
pip install zonefinder
```

## Usage
Here is a simple example to identify frequent price levels from your price data:
```python
import pandas as pd
from zonefinder import identify_frequent_price_levels, identify_support_resistance_zones

# Load your price data, must contain columns 'high', 'low', and 'close'
data = pd.read_csv('your_price_data.csv')

# Identify and Print the top 5 most frequent price levels
levels = identify_frequent_price_levels(data, rounding_digits=2, show_output=True)

# Detect the top 10 most frequent support and resistance zones with default epsilon = 0.1
zones = identify_support_resistance_zones(data, top_n=10, epsilon=0.1, show_output=True)
```
