â›“Use YAML classes in the validation of function schedule, transformation, schedule, location filters, raw table/DB, security category, space, and 3D (#1654)

# Description

The YAML classes we use for validation are already made. This PR
connects them to the loader class such that they will be used in the cdf
build command. In addition, I made a set of tests cases for each as well
as updated the function that humanize the pydantic errors.

security category, data modeling space, and 3D.
