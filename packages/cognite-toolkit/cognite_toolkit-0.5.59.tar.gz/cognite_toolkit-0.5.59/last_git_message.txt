This model will be required to run any other migration command. The
thinking is that migrating any of the core asset-centric resources
`assets`, `events`, `timeseries`, `files` and `sequences` should have an
entry in this model. Then, applications such as Charts, Canvas as well
as resources such as 3D and annotations can use this mapping in their
migration.
