**Features:**

* Automated deployment of a RESTful authorization API with Pulumi
* Integration with AWS Cognito for user management and authentication
* Lambda-based handlers for user registration, login, password management, and group assignment
* Token validation and secure API Gateway integration
* Easily configurable for different environments and user pool settings

**Intended Use:** Ideal for teams and projects that need a plug-and-play, cloud-native authorization backend with minimal setup, leveraging infrastructure-as-code best practices.
