# Authorization API for AWS Cognito (Pulumi Component)
> **Note:** ðŸš§ This project is currently under construction. Features and documentation may change frequently.

This repository provides a reusable Python package for deploying a secure, fully managed authorization REST API on AWS using Pulumi. The package provisions all necessary AWS resourcesâ€”including Cognito user pools, Lambda functions, and API Gateway endpointsâ€”to support robust user authentication, authorization, and user management workflows.

**Features:**

* Automated deployment of a RESTful authorization API with Pulumi
* Integration with AWS Cognito for user management and authentication
* Lambda-based handlers for user registration, login, password management, and group assignment
* Token validation and secure API Gateway integration
* Easily configurable for different environments and user pool settings

**Intended Use:** Ideal for teams and projects that need a plug-and-play, cloud-native authorization backend with minimal setup, leveraging infrastructure-as-code best practices.

Getting Started: See the documentation for installation, configuration, and usage examples.
