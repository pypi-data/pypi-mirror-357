A simulation framework for Chalmers devices that can be used to simulate the running of quantum algorithms with realistic noise. We follow [qutip-qip](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to build a processor that can take in a quantum circuit (e.g., a QASM cicruit) and performs a master equation simulation adding noise such as T1 and T2. It is also possible to perform a Monte-Carlo trajectory simulation and customize the processor to add various types of noise such as [ZZCrossTalk](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc/qutip_qip.noise.html#qutip_qip.noise.ZZCrossTalk).

The package is under development and testing.

## Installation

The main requirement to use this package is [qutip-qip](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) based on [qutip](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The Quantum Toolbox in Python. The requirements are already specified in the `setup.cfg` file and you can install the package `chalmers_qubit` simply by downloading this folder or cloning this repository and running:

```zsh
pip install .
```

to get the minimal installation. However, it might be beneficial to install an editable version. In the editable version, changes to the code are reflected system-wide without requiring a reinstallation.

```zsh
pip install -e .
```

If you do not care about making changes to the source code and just want to try out the package (e.g., from Google Colab), you can do a git+ install with

```zsh
pip install git+https://github.com/aqp-mc2-chalmers/chalmers-qubit.git
```

## Usage

The usage of the package follows [qutip-qip](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) where first, a quantum circuit is defined using [`qutip-qip`](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/qip-simulator.html) and then run on one of the custom Chalmers processors, e.g., the processor called sarimner. The custom processor is defined in `chalmers_qubit.devices.sarimner.processor` and can be initialized with a `model`, `compiler` and `noise`.

Note that only gates with compilation instructions in `chalmers_qubit/sarimner/compiler.py` will work for this particular processor.

Notebooks exploring the usage of the simulator is available in `docs/examples/`.

```python
import numpy as np
from qutip import basis, tensor
from qutip_qip.circuit import QubitCircuit
from chalmers_qubit.devices.sarimner import (
    SarimnerProcessor,
    SarimnerModel,
    SarimnerCompiler,
    DecoherenceNoise,
    ZZCrossTalk,
)

# Define a quantum circuit
qc = QubitCircuit(2)
qc.add_gate("RX", targets=0, arg_value=np.pi / 2)
qc.add_gate("RY", targets=1, arg_value=np.pi / 2)
qc.add_gate("CZ", controls=0, targets=1)

# All frequencies are defined in GHz, and times in ns.
transmon_dict = {
    0: {"frequency": 5.0, "anharmonicity": -0.30},
    1: {"frequency": 5.4, "anharmonicity": -0.30},
}
coupling_dict = {
    (0, 1): 0.04,
}
# Construct model
model = SarimnerModel(transmon_dict=transmon_dict,
                      coupling_dict=coupling_dict)

# Load a compiler
compiler = SarimnerCompiler(model=model)

# Define all the noise objects as a list.
decoherence_dict = {
    0: {"t1": 60e3, "t2": 80e3},
    1: {"t1": 100e3, "t2": 105e3},
}
cross_talk_dict = {
    (0, 1): 1e-4,
}
noise = [
    DecoherenceNoise(decoherence_dict=decoherence_dict),
    ZZCrossTalk(cross_talk_dict=cross_talk_dict),
]

# Initialize the processor
processor = SarimnerProcessor(model=model, compiler=compiler, noise=noise)

# Load the circuit that generates the pulses to run the simulation
tlist, coeffs = processor.load_circuit(qc)

# Initial state for the simulation.
# The default assumptions is that each transmon is a qudit with 3 levels.
init_state = tensor(basis(3, 1), basis(3, 1))

# Run master equation simulation
result = processor.run_state(init_state)
print("Final state", result.states[-1])

# Run the same circuit but with mcsolve using 100 trajectories.
result = processor.run_state(init_state, solver="mcsolve", ntraj=100)
print("Final state", result.states[-1])
```

It is also possible to import [QASM circuits](https://nbviewer.org/urls/qutip.org/qutip-tutorials/tutorials-v5/quantum-circuits/qasm.ipynb).

## Development

In order to add new custom pulses or modify the device, edit the processor, or compiler the tutorials and detailed instructions in [qutip-qip](https://qutip-qip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The [tutorials](https://qutip.org/qutip-tutorials/) show examples of how to customize the processor. If you have installed the package in the develop mode, any changes to the processor, e.g., adding a new gate will be reflected immediately system-wide without requiring a reinstallation of the package.
