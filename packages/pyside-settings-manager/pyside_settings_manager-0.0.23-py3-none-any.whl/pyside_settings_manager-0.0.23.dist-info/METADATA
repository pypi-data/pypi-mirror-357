Recursively save and restore states of PySide6 widgets using a handler-based system, providing a 'touched' state indicator and the ability to check for unsaved changes.

## Features

*   **Recursive Traversal:** Automatically finds and manages state for supported
    widgets within a `QMainWindow` or other container widgets like `QTabWidget` and `QGroupBox`.
*   **Handler-Based:** Provides a flexible system where the logic for saving, loading, comparing, and monitoring specific widget types is encapsulated in dedicated handler classes. Default handlers are provided for common PySide6 widgets.
*   **Extensible:** Easily register custom handlers for your own widget types or to override default behavior.
*   **Touched State:** Tracks whether any managed widget or custom data has been changed since the last `save` or `load` call.
*   **Unsaved Changes Check:** Provides a method to explicitly check if the current state of the managed widgets differs from a saved state (in the default settings or a specific file).
*   **Custom Data:** Save and load arbitrary pickleable Python objects alongside widget states.
*   **Skipping:** Explicitly exclude specific widgets from management.
*   **File-Based Settings:** Save and load states to/from `.ini` files using `QSettings`, including options to save/load to specific files.

## Supported Widgets (with default handlers)

*   `QMainWindow` (geometry and state)
*   `QCheckBox`
*   `QLineEdit`
*   `QPushButton` (if checkable)
*   `QComboBox` (index and text if editable)
*   `QSpinBox`
*   `QDoubleSpinBox`
*   `QRadioButton`
*   `QTextEdit`
*   `QTabWidget` (current index if managed)
*   `QSlider`

*(Note: Container widgets like `QWidget`, `QGroupBox` and `QTabWidget` are traversed to find managed children, but don't have their own state saved by default unless a specific handler is registered for them).*

## Installation

Via PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyside-settings-manager
```

Via GitHub, e.g. using `uv`:

```bash
uv add "git+https://github.com/danicc097/pyside-settings-manager.git@vX.Y.Z"
```

## Usage

1.  **Set the `SETTINGS_PROPERTY` property:** Add the property entry to widgets that you want to be managed. The property value should be a unique string identifier for that widget's state within the settings file scope. Widgets without this property will be ignored by default.
2.  **Create a `QSettings` instance:** Decide where you want your settings to be stored (e.g., application-specific user settings, a project file).

3.  **Create the `SettingsManager`:** Instantiate the manager with your `QSettings` object.
4.  **Load State:** Call `manager.load()` usually after your UI is fully set up. This will restore the saved states of your managed widgets from the default `QSettings`.
5.  **Save State:** Call `manager.save()` when you want to persist the current state of your managed widgets to the default `QSettings` (e.g., on application close, via a save button/shortcut).
6.  **Monitor Touched State:** Connect to the `touched_changed` signal or check the `is_touched` property to update UI elements (like enabling a "Save" button or adding an asterisk to the window title).
    ```python
    def on_touched_changed(touched):
        save_button.setEnabled(touched)
        window.setWindowTitle(f"My App {'*' if touched else ''}")

    manager.touched_changed.connect(on_touched_changed)
    ```
7.  **Check for Unsaved Changes:** Use `manager.has_unsaved_changes()` to determine if the current UI state differs from the last saved state, especially before closing or performing actions that would discard unsaved changes.

Check out the ``examples`` folder for self-contained demo apps:

```bash
uv run .\examples\basic.py
```

## Custom Handlers

You can register custom handlers for specific widget types or your own custom widgets by creating a class that implements the `pyside_settings_manager.settings::SettingsHandler` protocol:

```python
from typing import List, Any
from PySide6.QtCore import QSettings, SignalInstance, QWidget
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QLineEdit
from pyside_settings_manager.settings import SettingsHandler, SETTINGS_PROPERTY

class CustomUppercaseLineEditHandler(SettingsHandler):
    def save(self, widget: QLineEdit, settings: QSettings) -> None:
        settings.setValue(widget.property(SETTINGS_PROPERTY), widget.text().upper())

    def load(self, widget: QLineEdit, settings: QSettings) -> None:
        value = settings.value(widget.property(SETTINGS_PROPERTY), type=str)
        if value is not None:
            widget.setText(str(value))

    def compare(self, widget: QLineEdit, settings: QSettings) -> bool:
         """Returns True if current state != saved state"""
         key = widget.property(SETTINGS_PROPERTY)
         current_value: str = widget.text()
         # Load the value saved by this handler's save method (uppercase)
         saved_value = settings.value(key, type=str)
         if saved_value is None:
             return bool(current_value)

         return current_value.upper() != str(saved_value)


    def get_signals_to_monitor(self, widget: QLineEdit) -> List[SignalInstance]:
        # Return a list of signals that indicate a change requiring the 'touched' state
        return [widget.textChanged]

manager.register_handler(QLineEdit, CustomUppercaseLineEditHandler())
# Now, any QLineEdit with the ``SETTINGS_PROPERTY`` property will use your custom handler
# instead of the default one.
```

## Custom Data

You can save and load arbitrary pickleable data using `save_custom_data` and `load_custom_data`:

```python
manager.save_custom_data("user_preferences", {"theme": "dark", "font_size": 12})

prefs = manager.load_custom_data("user_preferences", dict) # {"theme": "dark", "font_size": 12}
```

Custom data is stored under a specific group based on ``CUSTOM_DATA_GROUP`` (e.g., `[customData]`). When using `save_to_file` and `load_from_file`, this custom data is also transferred. Note that `load_from_file` will overwrite any existing custom data in the manager's default `QSettings` with the custom data from the loaded file.

## Skipping Widgets

To prevent a specific widget instance from being saved, loaded, compared, or monitored for the `touched` state, use `skip_widget()`:

```python
manager.skip_widget(window.my_checkbox)

# Changes to window.my_checkbox will NOT mark the state as touched,
# and its state won't be saved, loaded, or compared.

# To re-enable management:
manager.unskip_widget(window.my_checkbox)
```

## Checking for Unsaved Changes

The `has_unsaved_changes()` method allows you to check if the current UI state for all *managed* (not skipped, has property, has handler) widgets differs from a saved state.

```python
# Check against the default settings file used by the manager
manager.has_unsaved_changes()
# Check against a specific settings file
manager.has_unsaved_changes(source="backup_settings.ini")
# Check against a specific QSettings object
alt_settings = QSettings("temp.ini", QSettings.Format.IniFormat)
# ...
manager.has_unsaved_changes(source=alt_settings)
```

This method traverses the managed widgets and calls their respective handlers'
`compare` methods. It returns `True` as soon as the first difference is
detected. It does *not* modify the UI or the manager's `is_touched` state.
Changes in custom data saved via `save_custom_data` are *not* considered by
`has_unsaved_changes`; these are immediately synced.

## Development

See the `src/tests` directory for detailed examples covering various widgets and handler behaviors.

To run tests using `uv`:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
