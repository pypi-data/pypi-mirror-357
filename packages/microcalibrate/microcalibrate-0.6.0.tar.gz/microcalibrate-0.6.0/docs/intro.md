## MicroCalibrate

MicroCalibrate is a framework that enables survey weight calibration integrating informative diagnostics and visualizations for the user to easily identify and work through hard-to-hit targets. A dashboard allows the user to explore the reweighting process on sample data as well as supporting uploading or pasting a link to the performance log of a specific reweighting job.

To access the performance dashboard see: https://microcalibrate.vercel.app/
