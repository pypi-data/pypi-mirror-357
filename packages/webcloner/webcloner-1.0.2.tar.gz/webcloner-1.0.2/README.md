## FAQ

| Question                              | Answer                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Why does it download external CDNs?* | Only same-domain links are crawled. Some CSS/JS may load CDN assets. |
| *Can I clone login-required sites?*   | Not yet. Youâ€™d need to add cookies manually in the script.           |
| *Is JavaScript executed?*             | No. This is a static grabber, no JS rendering.                       |
