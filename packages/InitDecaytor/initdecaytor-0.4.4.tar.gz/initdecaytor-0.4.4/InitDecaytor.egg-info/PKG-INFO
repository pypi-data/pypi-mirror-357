# InitDecaytor
##### _Thermal decomposition of free-radical initiators_

The purpose of this program is to simulate the thermal decomposition of 
free radical initiators based on reported kinetic data and a set of (virtual)
experimental parameters, such as the concentration and temperature.  

Currently, multiple charges of a variety of radical initiators are supported 
at a constant temperature. 
Alternatively, a temperature profile can be imported from the Huber SpyControl software. 
The end-time of the experiment can be visualized
based on a desired threshold of initiator relative to its maximum concentration.

Developed on a fresh python install (v3.13) with the most recent package versions in June 2025. 
In case of issues, please consider updating your packages. 

##### How to get started?
Install InitDecaytor:

```bash
pip install InitDecaytor
```

or upgrade if you've installed a previous version before:

```bash
pip install --upgrade InitDecaytor
```

Create a python script, for example `GUI.py`, containing the following code: 

```python
import InitDecaytor

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = InitDecaytor.GUI()
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Finally, run the script: 
```bash
python GUI.py
```
