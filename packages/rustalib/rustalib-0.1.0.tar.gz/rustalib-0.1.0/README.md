## 🚀 Installation

### 🔧 For Python users (from PyPI)

If you just want to use the library in your Python projects:

```bash
pip install rustalib
```

> This will install the precompiled Rust extension (wheels) published on PyPI.  
> Requires Python ≥ 3.8.

---

### 🛠️ For contributors or internal development

> ⚠️ The Rust core of this project is private.  
> You will not be able to build this project from source unless you have access to the Rust codebase.

If you are part of the internal team or have access to the Rust core, you can:

1. Make sure [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) are installed.
2. Clone the repo and install in development mode:

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

To build a distributable wheel:

```bash
maturin build
pip install target/wheels/rustalib-*.whl
```
---

## 📋 Requirements

To run the example scripts, you need to install the Python dependencies listed in:

```bash
examples/requirements.txt
```

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```

---

## 📁 Data source

All examples use SPY historical data downloaded via [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY), saved to:

```
examples/data/SPY_1D.csv
```

You can regenerate the CSV by running:

```bash
python examples/data/download_data.py
```

---


## 🧪 Example: Simple Moving Average (SMA)

Example file: [`examples/sma_example.py`](https://github.com/cuantilab/rustalib/blob/main/examples/sma_example.py)  
Uses real SPY data from 2020 to 2024.

```python
import pandas as pd
from rustalib import SMA

df = pd.read_csv("examples/data/SPY_daily.csv")
close_prices = df["Close"].tolist()

sma = SMA(20)
df["SMA20"] = sma.calculate_all(close_prices)

print(df[["Date", "Close", "SMA20"]].tail())
```

>💡 This is just one of the available indicators.
