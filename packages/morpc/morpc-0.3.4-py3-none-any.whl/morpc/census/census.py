def api_get(url, params, varBatchSize=20, verbose=True):
    """
    api_get() is a low-level wrapper for Census API requests that returns the results as a pandas dataframe. If necessary, it
    splits the request into several smaller requests to bypass the 50-variable limit imposed by the API.  The resulting dataframe
    is indexed by GEOID (regardless of whether it was requested) and omits other fields that are not requested but which are returned 
    automatically with each API request (e.g. "state", "county")

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : string
        url is the base URL of the desired Census API endpoint.  For example: https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1

    params : dict 
        (in requests format) the parameters for the query string to be sent to the Census API. For example:

        {
            "get": "GEO_ID,NAME,B01001_001E",
            "for": "county:049,041",
            "in": "state:39"
        }

    varBatchSize : integer, default = 20
        representing the number of variables to request in each batch. 
        Defaults to 20, Limited to 49.

    verbose : boolean
        If True, the function will display text updates of its status, otherwise it will be silent.

# acs_label_to_dimensions obtains the data dimensions associated with a particular variable by decomposing the "Label" column as described in the 
# Census API variable list, e.g. https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/variables.html. There is a label associated with each variable provided 
# by the API. For example, one label (for B25127_004E) looks like this:
#
# Estimate!!Total:!!Owner occupied:!!Built 2020 or later:!!1, detached or attached
#
# The dimensions for the variable are simply the collections of words are separated by ":!!".  For example, "Owner occupied" refers to tenure, "Built 2020 or later" 
# refers to the structure age, and "1, detached or attached" refers to the structure configuration or class.  Thus, the dimensions might be described as follows:
# dimensionNames = ["Tenure","Structure age","Structure class"]
#
# Inputs:
#   - labelSeries is a pandas Series object that contains a set of labels, one for each ACS variable of interest.  The indices of this series typically should match 
#         the dataframe that you want to join the dimension values to.
#   - dimensionNames is a list contains descriptions of the dimensions represented by each element in the label.  These will be used as column headers in the output
#         dataframe.  If dimensionNames is not provided, no column headers will be assigned.
#
# Outputs:
#    - df is a dataframe where each record represents the set of dimensions for an ACS variable and each column represents the value of one dimension for that 
#         variable. Continuing with the example above, a truncated output may look like this:
#
#         |              | Tenure         | Struture age        | Structure class         |
