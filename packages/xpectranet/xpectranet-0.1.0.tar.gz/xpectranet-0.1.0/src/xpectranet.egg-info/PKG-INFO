# 🧠 XpectraNet SDK

> The XpectraNet® Protocol is the first symbolic infrastructure for mesh cognition — enabling agents to think, align, and evolve through canonical memory and remixable insight.

---

## Turn Any App Into a Cognitive Agent

**Symbolic memory. Diffused state. Mesh-aware remixing.**

XpectraNet is the memory and cognition layer for agents, apps, and LLMs — enabling symbolic understanding, protocol-driven alignment, and resumption across time and context.

---

## 🚀 Why XpectraNet?

- **Structured Symbolic Memory**  
  Every input is minted as a CognitiveMemoryBlock (CMB): intent, emotion, commitment, abstraction layer, and more.

- **Diffused State Reconstruction**  
  Instantly reconstructs protocol-grade cognitive context at any point — not just token replay.

- **Conflict & Drift Resolution**  
  Built-in protocols detect contradiction, clarify ambiguity, and realign cognition.

- **Mesh-Aware Remixing & Canonization**  
  Fork, remix, and canonize memory trails — making every reasoning step auditable and reusable.

**No re-architecture required. Plug XpectraNet into any agent, LLM, or workflow.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
from xpectranet import mint_insight, diffuse_state

# Mint a symbolic memory block from user input
cmb = mint_insight("Where is my shipment?", role="user")

# Reconstruct protocol-level cognitive state
state = diffuse_state([], cmb)

print(state["intent"])      # → 'escalate'
print(state["emotion"])     # → 'concern'
print(state["commitment"])  # → 'resolve_delivery'
print(state["layer"])       # → 'L2'    # (Layer 2: Operations)
````

## 🛠️ Key SDK API

| Function                                  | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `mint_insight(text, role)`                | Mint a CognitiveMemoryBlock (CMB)             |
| `diffuse_state(trail, cmb)`               | Reconstruct current symbolic cognitive state  |
| `collapse_state(trail)`                   | Detect & resolve contradiction in memory      |
| `clarifier_agent(trail)`                  | Clarify ambiguity or drift in cognitive state |
| `remix_from_state(state, new_text, role)` | Fork/remix new CMB from prior state           |
| `canonize_state(state)`                   | Commit resolved state as immutable checkpoint |

## 🤖 Example: Customer Support Insight Trail

```python
from xpectranet import mint_insight, diffuse_state

# Step 1: Capture a customer's issue as protocol insight
customer_issue = mint_insight(
    "My order was supposed to arrive yesterday but hasn't shown up.",
    role="user"
)

# Step 2: Agent and system add protocol-grade events to the trail
trail = [
    customer_issue,
    mint_insight("We're sorry for the delay. Let me check your order status.", role="agent"),
    mint_insight("Order is delayed due to courier backlog. Estimated delivery: tomorrow.", role="system"),
    mint_insight("Please notify the customer and offer a discount.", role="policy"),
    mint_insight("Your order is scheduled for delivery tomorrow. As an apology, we've issued a discount.", role="agent"),
    mint_insight("Thank you for the update and the discount.", role="user")
]

# Step 3: Reconstruct final symbolic state for audit and compliance
final_state = diffuse_state(trail, trail[-1])
print("Intent:", final_state["intent"])          # → 'resolve'
print("Commitment:", final_state["commitment"])  # → 'fulfill_order_and_compensate'
print("Emotion:", final_state["emotion"])        # → 'relieved'
print("Layer:", final_state["layer"])            # → 'L2'
```

## 🏆 Feature Highlights

* 🧠 **Structured Symbolic Memory:** Not just text — capture meaning, intention, and focus.
* 🔄 **Cognitive State Reconstruction:** True protocol context, not token lists.
* 🛡️ **Conflict & Drift Resolution:** Agents self-correct and align.
* 🔗 **Auditable Mesh Memory:** Every step is traceable, remixable, and canonizable.
