## Output Format

By default, output is in YAML. For JSON output, use:

```bash
vcwin state --format json
```

## Example Usage

```bash
vcwin state
```

Shows installed versions of:
- Visual C++ Tools
- Windows SDK
- DirectX SDK

Search for all available packages (dxsdk, windows sdk, wdk):
```bash
vcwin search
```

Search for available SDK versions (you can search for 'sdk', 'wdk', 'dxsdk'):
```bash
vcwin search sdk
```

Downloads and installs the specified version of Windows Driver Kit:
```bash
vcwin install wdk 10.1.22621.2428
```

Fully uninstalls WDK and all its components:
```bash
vcwin uninstall wdk 10.1.22621.2428 --full
```
The --full flag ensures that all WDK uninstall components are removed.
For WDK, it also removes any WDK-related files or configuration from the associated Windows SDK of the same version.
The --full flag only matters when deleting wdk

You can also use the --show-string flag to just see what registry uninstall command would be used to remove a wdk package (not sdk related), but without actually removing the package. (wdk only, do not combine this flag with --full or sdk related packages will be removed):
```bash
vcwin uninstall wdk 10.1.22621.2428 --show-string
```

List all installed windows sdk:
```bash
vcwin list sdk
```

Install dxsdk:
```bash
vcwin install dxsdk 9.29.1962.0
```

Uninstall dxsdk:
```bash
vcwin uninstall dxsdk 9.29.1962.0
```

You can export the current state of all packages in JSON format using the following command:
```bash
vcwin state --format json > state.json
```

This will save the package state information to the state.json file for further analysis or use in other tools.
