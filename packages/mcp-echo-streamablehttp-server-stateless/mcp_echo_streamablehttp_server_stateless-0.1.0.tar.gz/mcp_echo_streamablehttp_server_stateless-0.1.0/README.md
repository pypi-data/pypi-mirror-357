### Testing OAuth Flows

Initialize the server with Bearer token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
      "capabilities": {},
      "clientInfo": {
        "name": "test-client",
        "version": "1.0.0"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

Analyze authentication context:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "authContext"
    },
