`scm-config-clone` is a command-line tool designed to seamlessly clone configuration objects between Palo Alto Networks
Strata Cloud Manager (SCM) tenants. From addresses and tags to application groups and security rules, this tool
streamlines migration tasks and reduces manual errors.

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: Store credentials and defaults in a `settings.yaml` file for reuse.
- **Robust Cloning**: Supports multiple object types (addresses, tags, services, security rules, IKE & IPsec VPN configurations, and more).
- **Extensive Filters**: Exclude specific folders, snippets, or devices to narrow down cloned objects.
- **Flexible Controls**: Run in `dry-run` mode, auto-approve changes, suppress console output, and create reports.
- **Commit & Push**: Automatically commit changes after objects are cloned.

## Installation

**Requirements**:

- Python 3.10 or higher

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install scm-config-clone
```

## Basic Usage

Once installed, the primary command is `scm-clone`. Running `--help` displays global options and available sub-commands:

```bash
scm-clone --help
```

You’ll see a list of commands like `addresses`, `tags`, `services`, `security-rules`, and `settings`.

## Creating the Settings File

Before cloning, create a `settings.yaml` file to store SCM credentials and defaults:

```bash
scm-clone settings
```

You’ll be prompted for source/destination credentials, logging level, and defaults for `auto_approve`, `create_report`,
`dry_run`, and `quiet`. Once done, `settings.yaml` will be created in the current directory. Subsequent commands read
from it, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials or defaults.

## Cloning Objects

With `settings.yaml` ready, cloning objects typically involves specifying a folder and object type. For example, to
clone address objects:

```bash
scm-clone addresses --source-folder "Texas"
```

If `auto_approve` is disabled by default in `settings.yaml`, you’ll be prompted before actual creation. If you wish to
override this at runtime:

```bash
scm-clone addresses --source-folder "Texas" -A
```

This command auto-approves without prompting. Similarly, to run in dry-run mode or commit after creation:

```bash
scm-clone addresses --source-folder "Texas" -D --commit-and-push
```

This simulates the creation without applying changes (`-D`) and would commit changes if actually applied. Remove `-D` to
run it for real.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with both unit and integration tests. Tests are written using pytest and use Factory Boy for creating test objects.

To run the tests:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
poetry install

# Run all tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh

# Run only unit tests
./run_tests.sh unit

# Run only integration tests
./run_tests.sh integration
```

For more details about the test suite, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
