Transformation functions
========================

.. currentmodule:: phoneshift


.. function:: transform(wav:ndarray, fs:float, pbf:float=1.0, pbfs:ndarray, esf:float=1.0, esp:boolean=True, psf:float=1.0, psf_max:float=2.0, clipper_knee:float=None, winlen_inner:float=0.020*fs, timestep:float=0.005*fs, f0_min:float=27.5, f0_max:float=3520, info:boolean=False) -> ndarray[float32]

    This is the generic function to transform a voice signal while applying multiple audio effects.
    See also below for more functions dedicated to specific tasks.

    .. note::
        It assumes the signal is *monophonic*, like a voice, a flute, a violin, saxophone, etc.

        It is *not* recommended to use it on polyphonic signals like a piano, a guitar, a drum set, etc.

    :arg wav: Input signal.
        Currently, spacialisation in a multichannel signal is not preserved.
        Multichannel signals are averaged through the channel dimension, processed and then duplicated to the same number of channels.

    :arg fs: Sampling rate [Hz].

    :arg pbf: Playback factor to do time scaling [coefficient, def. 1.0].

        .. note::
            The method is designed so that there is no global time drift possible.
            However, because internal frames need to be processed for ensuring signal continuity, audio events might be slightly shifted locally.

            For example, assuming a speed up of 2, an audio event at 60s, might end up at 30.005s, instead of 30s. Nevertheless, there is no time drift. So an audio event at 120s might end up at 60.005s, not 60.010s.

    :arg pbfs: Time varying playback factor [2D ndarray, def. None].
        A 2D numpy array of shape (N, 2) where N is the number of given pairs :py:attr:`[time, pbf]`.
        The first column is the time in seconds, relative to the original signal (not the transformed one).
        The second column is the :py:attr:`pbf` playback factor (as above).

    :arg esf: Envelope scaling factor [coefficient, def. 1.0].

    :arg esp: Preserve spectral envelope [boolean, def. True].
        Also known as "formants preservation".

    :arg psf: Pitch scaling factor [coefficient, def. 1.0].

    :arg psf_max: Maximum value for pitch scaling factor [coefficient, def. 2.0].

    :arg clipper_knee: Clipper knee amplitude [linear amplitude, def. None, common 0.66, `source <https://github.com/gillesdegottex/phaseshift/blob/main/phaseshift/sigproc/clipper.h>`_].
        This is to prevent the signal to clip at 1.0 when saving it in a file and create audio glitches.
        The knee amplitude is the point where the clipper starts to act.
        This will prevent the signal to go above ±1.0 in amplitude.
        The lower the value, the less glitches but the more the signal will be distorted.
        Set it to ``None`` to disable it.

    .. note::
        The following arguments are used to optimize the processing's audio quality and speed.
        They are not recommended to be changed unless you know what you are doing.

        You can use ``transform_timescaling`` and ``transform_pitchscaling`` that will automatically do it for for you depending on the task.

    :arg winlen_inner: Inner window length [#samples, def. 0.020*fs].
        This is the window length used for the inner processing.
        The bigger the value, the more stable the sound but the processing will be slower.

    :arg timestep: Inner window length [#samples, def. 0.005*fs].
        This is the time step from one frame to the next.
        The smaller the value, the more stable the sound but the processing will be slower.

    :arg f0_min: Minimum value for the fundamental frequency [Hz, def. 440/16=27.5].
        This is to prevent the pitch to go too low and create audio glitches.

    :arg f0_max: Maximum value for the fundamental frequency [Hz, def. 440*8=3520].
        This is to prevent the pitch to go too high and create audio glitches.

    :info: Returns an extra dict with various information related to how the processing went [def. False]

    :return:
        - `ndarray[float32]` - The modified signal.
            Shape will be the same as the input signal.
            The type will always be `float32` since the whole processing runs on `float32` precision.

        - `info[dict]` - Processing information [optional: only if argument :py:attr:`info=True`]

    :Examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        import phoneshift
        import soundfile
        wav, fs = soundfile.read('path/to/audio.wav')
        syn = phoneshift.transform(wav, fs, psf=2.0)
        soundfile.write('syn.wav', syn, fs)

    :Processing flow:

    The function :py:attr:`transform` is based on an `Overlap-Add process <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap%E2%80%93add_method>`_ whose base implementation is `freely available here <https://github.com/gillesdegottex/phaseshift/blob/main/phaseshift/audio_block/ola.h>`_.

    The different processing operations are done in the following order:

    .. image:: ../../../phoneshift/audio_block/vocoder_time.svg


.. function:: transform_timescaling(wav: ndarray, fs:float, **kwargs)

    Same arguments and return values as :func:`transform`.

    This function alter a few technical arguments of :func:`transform` in order to optimize speed for time scaling, without compromising audio quality.

.. function:: transform_pitchscaling(wav: ndarray, fs:float, **kwargs)

    Same arguments and return values as :func:`transform`.

    This function alter a few technical arguments of :func:`transform` in order to optimize speed for pitch scaling only, without compromising audio quality.
