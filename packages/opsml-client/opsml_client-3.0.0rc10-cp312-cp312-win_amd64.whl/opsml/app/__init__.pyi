    workflows where you wish create a shared state to share among all requests.
    The OpsML app state provides a convenient way to load and store artifacts.
    Most notably, it provides an integration with Scouter so that you can load a `CardDeck`
    along with a `ScouterQueue` for drift detection. Future iterations of this class may
    include other convenience methods that simplify common API tasks.
