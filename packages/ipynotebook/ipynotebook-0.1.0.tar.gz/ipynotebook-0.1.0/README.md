## Features

* **Single-file front-end** – React & particles.js are pulled from CDNs; no local web-server needed.  
* **Native window** – Ships as a PyPI package that opens a real desktop window (`chromium-embedded`).  
* **One-liner launch** – `pip install ipynotebook && ipynotebook` (or `python -m ipynotebook`).  
* **Hack-friendly** – Pass `--debug` to open Chromium DevTools and live-edit the UI.
