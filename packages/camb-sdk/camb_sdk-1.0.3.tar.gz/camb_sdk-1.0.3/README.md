- **Expressive Text-to-Speech**: Convert text into natural-sounding speech using a wide range of pre-existing voices.  
- **Generative Voices**: Create entirely new, unique voices from text prompts and descriptions.  
- **Soundscapes from Text**: Generate ambient audio and sound effects from textual descriptions.  
- Access to voice cloning, translation, and more (refer to full API documentation).

## üì¶ Installation

Install the SDK using pip, ensure **Python 3.9+**:

```bash
pip install camb-sdk
````

Or through

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Camb-ai/cambai-python-sdk
```

---

## üîë Authentication

To use the Camb AI SDK, you'll need an API key. You can authenticate in either of the following ways:

### 1. Pass the API key directly

```python
from cambai import CambAI

client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")
```

### 2. Use an environment variable
Set your API key as an environment variable named `CAMB_API_KEY`:

   ```bash
   export CAMB_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```
---

## üöÄ Getting Started: Examples

### 1. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Convert text into spoken audio using one of Camb AI's high-quality voices.

#### a) Get an Audio URL

This is useful if you want to play the audio in a web application or share a link.

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client (ensure API key is set)
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

try:
    print("Generating speech and getting audio URL...")
    audio_url = client.text_to_speech(
        text="Hello from Camb AI! This is a test of our Text-to-Speech API.",
        voice_id=20303  # Example voice ID, find more with client.list_voices()
    )
    print(f"Success! Your audio is ready at: {audio_url}")

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when calling text_to_speech: {e}\n")
```

#### b) Save Audio Directly to a File

Generate speech and save it as an MP3 file (or other supported formats).

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.models.output_type import OutputType 
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

file_path = "my_generated_speech.mp3"

try:
    print(f"Generating speech and saving to {file_path}...")

    client.text_to_speech(
        text="This is another test, saving directly to a file.",
        voice_id=20303,                # Example voice ID
        output_type=OutputType.RAW_BYTES,  # Specify raw bytes for direct saving
        save_to_file=file_path,
        verbose=True                   # For more detailed logging from the SDK
    )
    print(f"Success! Audio saved to {file_path}")

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when calling text_to_speech (save to file): {e}\n")
```

#### c) List Available Voices

You can list available voices to find a `voice_id` that suits your needs:

```python
try:
    voices = client.list_voices()
    print(f"Found {len(voices)} voices:")
    for voice in voices[:5]:  # Print first 5 as an example
        print(f"  - ID: {voice.id}, Name: {voice.voice_name}, Gender: {voice.gender}, Language: {voice.language}")
except ApiException as e:
    print(f"Could not list voices: {e}")
```

---

### 2. Text-to-Voice (Generative Voice)

Create completely new and unique voices from a textual description of the desired voice characteristics.

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

output_file = "generated_voice_output.mp3"

try:
    print("Generating a new voice and speech...")
    # The 'text_to_voice' method returns a dict consisting of 3 sample URLs
    # Description and Text should be atleast 100 Characters.
    result = client.text_to_voice(
        text="Crafting a truly unique and captivating voice that carries a subtle air of mystery, depth, and gentle warmth.",
        voice_description="A smooth, rich baritone voice layered with a soft echo, ideal for immersive storytelling and emotional depth.",
        verbose=True
    )
    print(result)

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when calling text_to_voice: {e}\n")
```

---
### 3. Text-to-Audio (Sound Generation)

Generate sound effects or ambient audio from a descriptive prompt.

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

output_file = "generated_sound_effect.mp3"

try:
    print(f"Generating sound effect and saving to {output_file}...")

    client.text_to_sound(
        prompt="A gentle breeze rustling through autumn leaves in a quiet forest.",
        duration=10,       
        save_to_file=output_file,
        verbose=True
    )
    print(f"Success! Sound effect saved to {output_file}")

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when calling text_to_sound: {e}\n")
```

---
### 4. Getting Client Source and Target Languages

Retrieve available source and target languages for translation and dubbing.

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

try:
    # Get all available target languages
    print("Listing target languages...")
    target_languages = client.get_target_languages()
    print(f"Found {len(target_languages)} target languages:")
    for language in target_languages:
        print(f"  - {language}")
    
    # Get all available source languages
    print("\nListing source languages...")
    source_languages = client.get_source_languages()
    print(f"Found {len(source_languages)} source languages:")
    for language in source_languages:
        print(f"  - {language}")

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when getting languages: {e}\n")
```

---
### 5. End-to-End Dubbing

Dub videos into different languages with voice cloning and translation capabilities.

```python
from cambai import CambAI
from cambai.rest import ApiException

# Initialize client
client = CambAI(api_key="YOUR_CAMB_API_KEY")

try:
    print("Starting end-to-end dubbing process...")
    
    result = client.end_to_end_dubbing(
        video_url="your_accesible_video_url",
        source_language=cambai.Languages.NUMBER_1,  # English
        target_languages=[cambai.Languages.NUMBER_81],  # Add more target languages as needed
        verbose=True
    )
    
    print("Dubbing completed successfully!")
    # The result contains output_video_url, output_audio_url, and transcript information with timing and speaker details
    print(f"Result: {result}")

except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Exception when calling end_to_end_dubbing: {e}\n")
```
