Napari plugin for reading videos using [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV). Inspired by the [napari-video](https://github.com/janclemenslab/napari-video) project, which served us very well for many years. For some long videos, however, its dependency on opencv caused seek glitches, so we implemented this alternative plugin based on PyAV.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
