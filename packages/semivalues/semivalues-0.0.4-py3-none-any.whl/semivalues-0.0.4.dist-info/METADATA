This package provides functionality to compute semivalues and related concepts. The most prominent example of a semivalue is the Shapley value.

Broad Functionality:
- Compute Shapley value exact or approximately
- Compute decomposition matrices based on the Shapley value

Detailed Functionality:
- Compute Shapley value (exact and approximately)
- Compute Shapley value decomposition by size (exact and approximately) (_n x n_ matrix where each entry is aggregated over the respective subset size)
- Compute [Shapley value of a player to another player](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s003550000070.pdf) (exact and approximately) (_Hausken, Kjell, and Matthias Mohr. "The value of a player in n-person games." Social Choice and Welfare 18 (2001): 465-483._)

For the approximation methods of the Shapley value we refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4265
