## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. By participating, you are expected to uphold this standard.

## I Have a Question

Before asking a question, it's best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/DeepPythonist/DeepRecon/issues) that might help you. If you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/DeepPythonist/DeepRecon/issues/new)
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Provide project and platform versions (Python, OS, etc.)

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:

- Make sure you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side
- Check if other users have experienced the same issue
- Collect information about the bug

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/DeepPythonist/DeepRecon/issues/new)
- Use our bug report template
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
- Please provide as much context as possible

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for DeepRecon, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.

## Coding Guidelines

### Code Style
