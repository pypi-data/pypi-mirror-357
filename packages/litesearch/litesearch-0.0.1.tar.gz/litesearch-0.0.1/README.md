# litesearch

**LiteSearch** is a unified and extensible AI-powered search abstraction layer designed to simplify interaction with multiple search engines, integrate structured result processing, and provide advanced semantic retrieval capabilities.

Whether you're building an intelligent agent, research assistant, or search analytics tool, LiteSearch offers a modern framework that bridges traditional search engine results with AI-native applications.

## üîç Key Features

### üåê Unified Search Engine Interface

Access and aggregate search results from **10+ search engines** (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Brave, etc.) through a consistent API. Easily switch or combine engines without changing your codebase.

### üß† Dual Execution Modes: API + Headless Browser

Supports both:

* **Official/Unofficial Search APIs** for fast, structured access
* **Headless browser automation** for scraping and bypassing limitations when APIs are restricted or unavailable

### üßæ Structured Output for LLM Consumption

Parses and formats results from the **Search Engine Result Page (SERP)** into clean, structured content such as:

* Markdown summaries
* JSON metadata (title, snippet, URL, etc.)
* Optional screenshots or HTML for visualization/debugging

Ideal for LLM agents that require context-rich, readable content.

### üìö Document Chunking + Semantic Search

Fetched content can be automatically:

* Downloaded and cleaned (HTML -> Text)
* **Chunked** into semantically meaningful units (headings, paragraphs, etc.)
* Embedded using **LLM-compatible vector embeddings**
* Queried via natural language prompts using vector similarity

### üß± Vector Store Integrations

Plug-and-play compatibility with major vector database backends:

* **Weaviate**
* **ChromaDB**
* **FAISS**
* **Pinecone**
* Custom adapters supported

Allows users to build searchable knowledge bases or augment LLM prompts using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines.
