[NEAT-1122] üêõ Inferred indices (#1243)

# Description

In the conversion of index from phycial model to DMS schema, I assumed
in the original implementation that `Undefined` is a singleton and it
turns out that is not the case.

The following screenshot is from stopping the conversion of indices:

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Fixed

- Neat no longer silently fails for `neat.to.cdf.data_model(...)` when
indices does not specify `btree` or `inverted`. Note this bug was
introduced in `0.123.0`
