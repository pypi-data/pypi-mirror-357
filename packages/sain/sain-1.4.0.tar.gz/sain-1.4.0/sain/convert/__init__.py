"""
Protocols for conversions between types.

The protocols in this module provide a way to convert from one type to another type. Each trait serves a different purpose:

* Implement the From trait for consuming value-to-value conversions
* Implement the Into trait for consuming value-to-value conversions to types outside the current crate
* The TryFrom and TryInto traits behave like From and Into, but should be implemented when the conversion can fail.
* Implement the `ToString` trait for explicitly converting objects to string.

Example
--------
```py
@dataclass
class Id(From[UUID], Into[int]):
    id: int | float

    @classmethod
    def from_value(cls, value: UUID) -> Self:
        # Keep in mind, this stores a 128 bit <long> integer.
        return cls(int(value))

    def into(self) -> int:
        return int(self.id)

# Simply perform conversions.
from_uuid = Id.from_value(uuid4())
into_int = from_uuid.into()
```

For type conversions that may fail, two safe interfaces, `TryInto` and `TryFrom` exist which deal with that.

This is useful when you are doing a type conversion that may trivially succeed but may also need special handling.

```py
@dataclass
class Message(Into[bytes], TryFrom[bytes, None]):
    content: str
    id: int

    def into(self) -> bytes:
        return json.dumps(self.__dict__).encode()

    @classmethod
    def try_from(cls, value: bytes) -> Result[Self, None]:
        try:
            payload = json.loads(value)
            return Ok(cls(content=payload['content'], id=payload['id']))
        except (json.decoder.JSONDecodeError, KeyError):
            # Its rare to see a JSONDecodeError raised, but usually
            # keys goes missing, which raises a KeyError.
            return Err(None)

message_bytes = b'{"content": "content", "id": 0}'

match Message.try_from(message_bytes):
    case Ok(message):
        print("Successful conversion", message)
    case Err(invalid_bytes):
        print("Invalid bytes:", invalid_bytes)

payload = Message(content='content', id=0)
assert payload.into() == message_bytes
```

    As the Rust documentation says, One should always prefer implementing From over Into
    because implementing From automatically provides one with an implementation of Into.

    But there's no such thing in Python, as it's impossible to auto-impl `Into<T>` for all types
    that impl `From<T>`.

    So for the sake of simplicity, You should implement whichever interface you want deal with,
    Or simply, implement both as the same time.

    Generic Implementations
    -------------------
    This interface takes two type arguments, and return `Result<Self, E>`

    * `T`: Which's the first generic `T` is the type that's being converted from.
    * `E`: If the conversion fails in a way, this is what will return as the error.
    * `Self`: Which's the instance of the class that is being converted into.

    Example
    -------
    ```py
    @dataclass
    class Id(TryFrom[str, str]):
        value: int

        @classmethod
        def try_from(cls, value: str) -> Result[Self, str]:

                # NaN
                return Err(f"Couldn't convert: {value} to self")
            # otherwise convert it to an Id instance.
            return Ok(value=cls(int(value)))
