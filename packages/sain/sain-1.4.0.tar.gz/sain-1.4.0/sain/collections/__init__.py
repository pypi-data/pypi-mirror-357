"""Dynamically growable collections and containers.

These collections are basic implementations of Rust's standard collections crate. from under the hood, they're an extended
and more rich implementations of the built-in sequences such as `list` and `bytearray`.

### When Should You Use Which Collection?
This question's answer should be pretty straightforward.

* Use `Vec` when you want to replace `list`.
* Use `Bytes` when you want to store read-only bytes. The underlying sequence is an `array` of type `u8`.
* Use `BytesMut` when you want a mutable version of `Bytes`.
* Use `HashMap` when you want to replace `dict`.
