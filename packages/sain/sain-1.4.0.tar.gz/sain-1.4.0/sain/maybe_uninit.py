    """A wrapper type to construct uninitialized instances of `T`.

    This is kinda equivalent to Rust's `MaybeUninit<T>` wrapper.

    The difference is what's happening under the hood is when initializing an instance of this object,
    nothing really is being initialized, until you call `.write()` to initialize the inner value.

    What??
    -----
    Ok, so `MaybeUninit<T>` is in a sense the unsafe equivalent of `Option<T>`, it either contains a value of type `T`,
    or it contains uninitialized memory (`the attribute doesn't exist`).

    However, `MaybeUninit` is unable to tell you whether the value it contains is `Some(T)` or `None`, So you
    as a programmer is responsible for initializing it.

    And by default, `Option<T>` always contain a default value, which is `None`.

    Examples
    --------
    ```py
    # Let's write a simple wrapper around `MaybeUninit<T>` to create a dynamic array.
    class SizedArray[T]:
        def __init__(self, size: int) -> None:
            # Creates count `size` of `MaybeUninit<T>` in an uninitialized state.
            self.buf = MaybeUninit[T].uninit_array(size)
            # Track how many initialized elements are in the array.
            self.len = 0

        def push(self, value: T) -> None:
            # if the length of the array is equal to the size of the array,
            # then we've reached the max size of the array.
            if self.len == len(self.buf):
                raise RuntimeError("max size reached")

            # get the next uninitialized element and write into it.
            self.buf[self.len].write(value)
            self.len += 1

            spared = self.buf[self.len:]
            other_len = len(other)
            # Check if there's enough capacity to copy the other list into the array.
            if len(spared) < other_len:
                raise RuntimeError("not enough space")

            # Copy the other list into the array.
            index = 0
            while index < other_len:
                self.buf[self.len + index].write(other[index])
                index += 1
