# PPVC (Python Package Version Checker)

PPVC is a simple and efficient command-line utility that queries PyPI (Python Package Index) for available versions of Python packages. It's designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use.

## Features

- List all available versions of a Python package
- Get only the latest version of a package
- Limit the number of versions displayed
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Fast response times
- Error handling for network issues and non-existent packages
- Beautiful colorized output with formatted tables
- Version type classification (Final, Pre-release, Post-release)

## Installation

You can install PPVC using pip:

```bash
pip install ppvc
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

List all available versions of a package:

```bash
ppvc requests
```

### Get Latest Version

Show only the latest version of a package:

```bash
ppvc requests --latest
```

### Limit Versions

Show only the first N versions:

```bash
ppvc django --limit 5
```

### Examples

```bash
# List all versions of the requests package
ppvc requests

# Get the latest version of numpy
ppvc numpy --latest

# Check versions of a specific package
ppvc django

# Show only the 10 most recent versions
ppvc flask --limit 10
```

## Command Line Options

- `--help`: Show help message
- `--version`: Show version information
- `--latest`: Show only the latest version
- `--limit N`: Limit the number of versions shown to N

## Error Handling

PPVC provides clear error messages for common issues:

- Package not found on PyPI
- Network connection problems
- Invalid package names

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection to access PyPI
- packaging>=23.0 (for version parsing)
- rich>=13.0.0 (for terminal formatting)
