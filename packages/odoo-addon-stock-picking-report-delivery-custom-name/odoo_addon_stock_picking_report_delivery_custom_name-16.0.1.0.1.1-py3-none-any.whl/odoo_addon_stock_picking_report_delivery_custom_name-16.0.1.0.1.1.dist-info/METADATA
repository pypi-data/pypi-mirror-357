Use Cases / Context
===================

In some bussinesses even the internal references used in the product are
considered strategic information that should be kept secret.

Configuration
=============

In order to set a default picking description:

- Go to *Inventory > Products \* Products* and chose the one you want.
- Click on the *Inventory* tab and go to the *Description for Delivery
  orders* field.
- Set the text you want your customers to see.

You can also use this module along with
``stock_picking_report_custom_description`` in order to get the
descriptions from the sales directly.

Usage
=====

To test this module, you can first configure the products with their
puclic descriptions or set them in the picking operations.

- Go to *Inventory > Overview* and click in the *Delivery orders* orders
  to process.
- Choose one and in the *Operations* tab, use the columns selector to
  reveal the **Description** one.
- You can edit with the text you want to in the lines you want to.
- Print the delivery slip from the print menu in the header.
- You'll see just the description where you set it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Allow to add exceptions at product level (a simple flag would do) to
  allow to keep the standard behavior in some exceptions.
