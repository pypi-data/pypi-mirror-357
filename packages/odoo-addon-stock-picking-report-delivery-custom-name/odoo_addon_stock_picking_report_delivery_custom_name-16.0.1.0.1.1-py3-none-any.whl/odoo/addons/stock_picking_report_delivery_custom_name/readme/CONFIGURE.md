In order to set a default picking description:

- Go to *Inventory > Products * Products* and chose the one you want.
- Click on the *Inventory* tab and go to the *Description for Delivery orders* field.
- Set the text you want your customers to see.

You can also use this module along with `stock_picking_report_custom_description` in
order to get the descriptions from the sales directly.
