- by default, do not use docstrings or function or module comments
- reserve comments only for rare edge cases that would not be understood otherwise
- use `list`, `dict`,... instead of legacy types in `typing`
- use `| None`  instead of `Optional`  whenever possible
- make sure linters don't complain in files you modify
