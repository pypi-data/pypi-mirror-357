DESCRIPTION = """
Shows differences between commits, commit and working tree, etc. using git diff.
This tool is read-only and safe to use with any arguments.
The arguments parameter should be a string and will be interpreted as space-separated
arguments using shell-style tokenization (spaces separate arguments, quotes can be used
for arguments containing spaces, etc.).

Example:
  git diff  # Show changes between working directory and index
  git diff HEAD~1  # Show changes between current commit and previous commit
  git diff branch1 branch2  # Show differences between two branches
  git diff --stat  # Show summary of changes instead of full diff
