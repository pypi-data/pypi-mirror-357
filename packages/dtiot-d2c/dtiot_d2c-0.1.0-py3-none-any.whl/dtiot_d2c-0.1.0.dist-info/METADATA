# Device to Cloud Command Line Interface
The command line program ```d2c``` implements for the IoT platform **Device to Cloud** (**D2C**) from **Deutsche Telekom IoT GmbH** (**DTIOT**) a command line interface. By this IoT system administrators shall be supported and the implementation of shell script automation shall be enabled.  The command ```d2c``` comes with a wide range of sub-commands to access the **D2C** system via the **DMO** API (Device Management Orchestrator), also from **DTIOT**.  

# Install or update
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade dtiot_d2c
```
  
> ** INFO **  
> Pip not only installs the python packages into you local site-packages it also generates the executable ```d2c```.  
> For Windows make sure that the directory **%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXX\Scripts** (or similar) is in your search path. If not you cannot execute ```d2c``` on the command line.  
  
# Getting help
```bash
