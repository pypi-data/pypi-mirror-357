              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Repository Structure

Each qubots repository follows a standardized structure:

```
repository/
├── qubot.py          # Main implementation file
├── config.json       # Configuration and metadata
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies (optional)
└── README.md        # Documentation (optional)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Loading and Running Optimizations

Here's how to load problems and optimizers from repositories and run optimizations:

```python
from qubots import AutoProblem, AutoOptimizer

# Load a problem from a repository
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo("ileo/demo-maxcut")

# Load an optimizer from a repository
optimizer = AutoOptimizer.from_repo("ileo/demo-ortools-maxcut-optimizer")

# Run optimization
result = optimizer.optimize(problem)

print(f"Best Solution: {result.best_solution}")
print(f"Best Value: {result.best_value}")
print(f"Runtime: {result.runtime_seconds:.3f} seconds")
print(f"Iterations: {result.iterations}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can override parameters when loading problems and optimizers:

```python
from qubots import AutoProblem, AutoOptimizer

# Load problem with custom parameters
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo("ileo/demo-maxcut", override_params={
    "n_vertices": 20,
    "graph_type": "random",
    "density": 0.3
})

# Load optimizer with custom parameters
optimizer = AutoOptimizer.from_repo("ileo/demo-ortools-maxcut-optimizer", override_params={
    "time_limit": 60.0,
    "num_search_workers": 4,
    "log_search_progress": True
})

# Run optimization with callbacks
def progress_callback(iteration, best_value, current_value):
    print(f"Iteration {iteration}: Best={best_value}, Current={current_value}")

def log_callback(level, message, source):
    print(f"[{level.upper()}] {source}: {message}")

result = optimizer.optimize(
    problem,
    progress_callback=progress_callback,
    log_callback=log_callback
)
```

## 🌐 Rastion Platform Integration

Qubots integrates with the Rastion platform for collaborative optimization development:

### Repository-Based Loading

The framework loads optimization components directly from Git repositories:

```python
from qubots import AutoProblem, AutoOptimizer

# Load from public repositories
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo("username/problem-repo")
optimizer = AutoOptimizer.from_repo("username/optimizer-repo")

# Load from specific branches or revisions
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo("username/problem-repo", revision="v1.2.0")
optimizer = AutoOptimizer.from_repo("username/optimizer-repo", revision="development")
```

### Caching and Performance

The framework automatically caches repositories for improved performance:

```python
# Repositories are cached in ~/.cache/rastion_hub by default
# Subsequent loads are much faster

# Custom cache directory
problem = AutoProblem.from_repo(
    "username/problem-repo",
    cache_dir="./my_cache"
)
```
