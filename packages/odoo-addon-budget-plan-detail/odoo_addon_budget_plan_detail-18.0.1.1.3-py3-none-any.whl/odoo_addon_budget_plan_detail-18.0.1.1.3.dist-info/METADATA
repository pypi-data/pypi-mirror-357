This module is the main module for manage allocation until set budget
control. For this module, budget constraints will be used to check the
allocation to ensure that the budget is not exceeded beyond the
allocated amount.

Example usage:

.. code:: python

   Budget allocation has allocation:
     Allocation Line | Analytic Account | Fund  | Tags | Allocated | ...
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     1               |               A  | Fund1 | Tag1 |     100.0 | ...
     2               |               A  | Fund2 | Tag2 |     100.0 | ...

   Condition constraint (e.g. invoice lines)
     - User can use:
     Document | Line | Analytic Account | Fund  | Tags | Amount |
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     INV001   |    1 |             A    | Fund1 | Tag1 | 130.0  | >>> Error (-30)
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     INV002   |    1 |             A    | Fund1 |      | 10.0 | >>> Not allocated
     INV002   |    1 |             A    | Fund1 | Tag1 | 10.0 | >>> balance 90
     INV002   |    2 |             A    | Fund1 | Tag1 | 60.0 | >>> balance 30
     ----------------------------Confirm----------------------------
     INV003   |    1 |             A    | Fund1 | Tag1 | 10.0 | >>> balance 20
     INV003   |    2 |             A    | Fund1 | Tag1 | 60.0 | >>> Error (-40)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     INV004   |    1 |             A    | Fund2 | Tag1 |120.0 | >>> Not allocated
     INV004   |    1 |             A    | Fund2 | Tag2 |120.0 | >>> Error (-20)

Budget Allocation Core Features:
--------------------------------

- | **Budget Allocation (budget.allocation)**
  | A new menu for detailed allocation, such as projects that receive
    funding from multiple sources and different amounts of money, must
    have budget control according to the source of funds to avoid
    exceeding what has been received. Budget allocation will help manage
    this.

- | **Source of Fund (budget.source.fund)**
  | Adding new master data Source of Fund

- | **Budget Source Fund Monitoring (budget.source.fund.report)**
  | Add a menu for monitoring reports by source of funds.

- | **Analytic Tag Dimension**
  | Add a new Tag so that users can add additional perspectives for
    viewing reports.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

At first you have to create Source of Funds Master data. First, you must
create a Source of Fund in the master data. Then, you will need to
create a budget allocation to control detailed budget usage.

Create master data (Source of fund)
-----------------------------------

1. Go to menu Budgeting > Configurations > Source of Funds
2. Create your source of fund and Group of fund (optional)

Create budget allocation for planning
-------------------------------------

1. Go to menu Budgeting > Budget Allocation
2. Create a new budget allocation, which will depend on the budget
   period (1 budget allocation per budget period can be created).
3. In each line, add details with the analytic account, fund, and
   amount.
4. Click "Done" to automatically generate the budget plan.
5. Follow the normal process for the budget plan.

NOTE: In budget allocation, there are 3 different amounts to consider:

1. "Estimated Amount" refers to the total budget that is expected to be
   received within a particular year.
2. "Allocated" refers to the budget that has been allocated to a
   particular project, to be used as needed. The allocated amount must
   not exceed the Estimated amount.
3. "Released" refers to the budget that is currently available.
   Initially, the released amount is equal to the allocated amount and
   will change as budget transfers occur.
