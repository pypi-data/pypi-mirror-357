At first you have to create Source of Funds Master data. First, you must
create a Source of Fund in the master data. Then, you will need to
create a budget allocation to control detailed budget usage.

## Create master data (Source of fund)

1.  Go to menu Budgeting \> Configurations \> Source of Funds
2.  Create your source of fund and Group of fund (optional)

## Create budget allocation for planning

1.  Go to menu Budgeting \> Budget Allocation
2.  Create a new budget allocation, which will depend on the budget
    period (1 budget allocation per budget period can be created).
3.  In each line, add details with the analytic account, fund, and
    amount.
4.  Click "Done" to automatically generate the budget plan.
5.  Follow the normal process for the budget plan.

NOTE: In budget allocation, there are 3 different amounts to consider:

1.  "Estimated Amount" refers to the total budget that is expected to be
    received within a particular year.
2.  "Allocated" refers to the budget that has been allocated to a
    particular project, to be used as needed. The allocated amount must
    not exceed the Estimated amount.
3.  "Released" refers to the budget that is currently available.
    Initially, the released amount is equal to the allocated amount and
    will change as budget transfers occur.
