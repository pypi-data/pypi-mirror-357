<h2> go4py: ⚡ Supercharge your Python with Go ⚡ </h2>
</div>

Do you ever wish Python were faster? `go4py` is here to help!
Enjoy the speed and simplicity of Go within Python! You can write bottlenecks of your Python code as CGo functions. The `go4py` will automatically generate a Python module from it for you!

Check the performance boost in our [benchmarks](docs/benchmark.md) and get a sense of how much faster it can be compared to basic Python! 🚀


## Installation
#### Linux
 1. Install Go
 2. `pip install go4py`
#### Windows
 1. Install Go
 2. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and then install [mingw-toolchain](https://packages.msys2.org/groups/mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain) inside it.
 3. Install `go4py` in a python vitrual exnvironment.
 4. Open a mingw shell and activate the venv inside it (e.g. `source venv/Scripts/activate`)
 5. Add Go to your PATH in the mingw shell (e.g., `export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Go/bin/"`)


## Usage
 To create a Go package inside your Python project:
```shell
 go4py init <module_name>
```
 This will create a directory with the name `<module_name>` and add `go.mod` to your project.
 You can go to `<module_name>/src` directory and add your Go functions there.

 To build the Go package and generate bindings code for the Python module:
```shell
 go4py build <module_name>
```

You can now import the functions as methods of a python module:
```python
from <module_name> import <function_name>
```
Please note that we convert the function names' first character to lower case.

## How it works
There is a Makefile in the created directory with four major steps:
1. Parsing the Go code and extracting the signatures of the functions (the `functions.json` file).
2. Building an object file from Go code (`.a` and `.h` files).
3. Making a C wrapper for the Go functions as a Python native C extension.
4. Building a shared library from the generated C code (`__init__.so` file or `__init__.pyd` file).

The Makefile is actually quite readable, and you can modify it to your needs `go4py` will just run it 

## Documentation
[This documentation](docs/documentation.md) will explain how to use go4py. there is also a [examples](examples) directory for some examples. But if you need to dive into inner-workings of `go4py` take a look at the [tests](tests) directory and checkout the codes that `go4py` generates automaticly from a go function signature.
