How to Set Multiple Barcodes for a Product:
============================================

1. Navigate to Products
2. Select the desired product
3. Add custom barcodes in the "Barcodes" field
4. Set barcode priority by moving them up or down in the sequence
5. Save the product

Note: A list of barcodes is available for each product with a priority, so a main barcode
code is defined.
