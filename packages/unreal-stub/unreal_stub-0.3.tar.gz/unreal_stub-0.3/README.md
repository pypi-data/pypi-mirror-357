# Unreal Stub

Project found at: [https://pypi.org/project/unreal-stub/](https://pypi.org/project/unreal-stub/)

Unreal Stub is a Python package that provides a stub file for Unreal Engine's Python API. 
With this package you can use the Unreal Engine Python API in your Python scripts, without having to go through all
the hassle of setting up Python with Unreal copying the stub file and having the inevitable slow down
when you try to read the file. With this just `pip install unreal-stub` and you can import it like any other dependency.

I recommend using UV as your package manager likewise you can use `uv add unreal-stub` to add it to your project.
