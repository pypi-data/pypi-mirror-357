# LED Matrix Battery Monitor

A Python application that displays your computer's battery status on an LED matrix display. The application monitors battery level and power state, providing visual feedback on an LED matrix and audio notifications when power is plugged or unplugged.

## Project Description and Purpose

The LED Matrix Battery Monitor is designed to provide a visual representation of your computer's battery status on an external LED matrix display. It serves as a convenient way to monitor battery levels without having to check your computer's status bar, especially useful for setups where the status bar might not be visible or when you want a more noticeable indicator.

Key features:
- Real-time battery level display on an LED matrix
- Visual animations when power is plugged in
- Audio notifications when power state changes (plugged/unplugged)
- Configurable checking intervals
- Support for multiple LED matrices

## Hardware Requirements

- LED Matrix display with dimensions 9x34 (compatible with the project's specifications)
- Serial connection to the computer (USB)
- The LED matrix should have the following hardware identifiers:
  - VID: 0x32AC
  - PID: 0x20
  - Serial Number Prefix: FRAK

## Software Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.12 or newer and the following dependencies:

- chime (>=0.7.0,<0.8.0) - For audio notifications
- pyserial (>=3.5,<4.0) - For serial communication with the LED matrix
- inspy-logger (>=3.2.3,<4.0.0) - For logging
- inspyre-toolbox (>=1.6.0) - Utility functions
- pillow (>=11.2.1,<12.0.0) - Image processing
- opencv-python (>=4.11.0.86,<5.0.0.0) - Image processing
- pysimplegui-4-foss (>=4.60.4.1,<5.0.0.0) - GUI components
- tk (>=0.1.0,<0.2.0) - GUI toolkit
- easy-exit-calls (>=1.0.0.dev1,<2.0.0) - Exit handling
- psutil - For battery status monitoring

## Installation Instructions

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Inspyre-Softworks/led-matrix-battery.git
   cd led-matrix-battery
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

### Using pip

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Inspyre-Softworks/led-matrix-battery.git
   cd led-matrix-battery
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

To start monitoring your battery with default settings:

```python
from is_matrix_forge.monitor import run_power_monitor
from is_matrix_forge.led_matrix.helpers.device import DEVICES

# Get the first available LED matrix device
device = DEVICES[0]

# Start monitoring with default settings
run_power_monitor(device)
```

### Custom Configuration

To customize the monitoring behavior:

```python
from is_matrix_forge.monitor import run_power_monitor
from is_matrix_forge.led_matrix.helpers.device import DEVICES
from pathlib import Path

# Get the first available LED matrix device
device = DEVICES[0]

# Custom sound files
plugged_sound = Path("path/to/custom_plugged_sound.wav")
unplugged_sound = Path("path/to/custom_unplugged_sound.wav")

# Start monitoring with custom settings
run_power_monitor(
    device,
    battery_check_interval=10,  # Check every 10 seconds
    plugged_alert=plugged_sound,
    unplugged_alert=unplugged_sound
)
```

### Running in a Thread

To run the monitor in a background thread:

```python
from is_matrix_forge.monitor import run_power_monitor_threaded
from is_matrix_forge.led_matrix.helpers.device import DEVICES

# Get the first available LED matrix device
device = DEVICES[0]

# Start monitoring in a background thread
monitor = run_power_monitor_threaded(device)
# ``monitor`` is a :class:`threading.Thread` instance
```

## Troubleshooting

### LED Matrix Not Detected

1. Check that the LED matrix is properly connected to your computer.
2. Verify that the LED matrix has the correct hardware identifiers (VID, PID, SN_PREFIX).
3. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the serial port.
4. Try running the application with administrator/root privileges.

### Audio Notifications Not Working

1. Ensure your system's audio is working correctly.
2. Check that the WAV files for notifications exist in the expected locations.
3. Verify that the chime library is properly installed.

### Battery Status Not Updating

1. Make sure psutil is properly installed.
2. Check that your system supports battery status monitoring through psutil.
3. Try increasing the battery_check_interval to reduce CPU usage.

### Animation Issues

1. Verify that the LED matrix is functioning correctly.
2. Check that the matrix dimensions match the expected 9x34 size.
3. Try clearing the matrix and restarting the application.
