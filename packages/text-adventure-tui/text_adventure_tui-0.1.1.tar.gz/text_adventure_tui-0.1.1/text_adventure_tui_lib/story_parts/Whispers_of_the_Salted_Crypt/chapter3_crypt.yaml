        You carefully make your way down the slick rocks and step through the ancient archway.
        The air immediately becomes still and heavy with the smell of salt and decay.
        You are in a small antechamber, and before you stands a massive, circular stone
        door sealed with intricate bronze bands. A single, rune-etched keyhole sits in its center.

        You insert the Tycendi Runic Key into the lock. The runes on the key and the door
        flare with a bright blue light. With a deep groan of grinding stone, the massive
        door slides open.

        The chamber beyond is vast. Piles of gold and ancient artifacts lie in dusty heaps,
        but your attention is drawn to the center of the room. There, tied to a stone
        altar, is Master Elian! He is alive, though he looks weak. "By the archives!" he rasps, his eyes
        widening in disbelief. "You found me!"
