title: "The Missing Locket"
starting_location: "village_path" # Initial location for the player
total_turns_estimate: 10

checkpoints:
  - turn: 1 # This will be mostly superseded by the initial event, but good as a fallback.
    prompt_injection: "The path ahead leads towards the Whispering Woods. You feel a sense of unease."
  - turn: 4
    prompt_injection: "Deepening shadows stretch across the path as you venture further into the woods. The air is cool and smells of damp earth and pine."
  - turn: 7
    prompt_injection: "You hear the gentle gurgling of a stream nearby and spot a moss-covered, ancient-looking shrine through the trees."
    # This checkpoint helps guide the player if they haven't found the shrine via exploration/LLM.
  - turn: 10 # Final Turn
    prompt_injection: | # This injection will be combined with the event outcome for the locket
      The sun begins to set, casting long, eerie shadows. It's time to head back to the village.
      As you reflect on your search for the locket...
    force_end_game: true
    # The actual outcome text (locket found/not found) will be handled by an event or by checking a flag
    # directly in the game_loop's end-game message, based on the "locket_retrieved" flag.
    # For simplicity with current system, the event setting this flag would be primary.
    # This checkpoint mainly ensures the game ends.
