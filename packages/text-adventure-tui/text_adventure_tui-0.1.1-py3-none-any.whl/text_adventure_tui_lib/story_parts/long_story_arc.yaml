  - turn: 1
    prompt_injection: "The outskirts of the village are eerily quiet. A sickly, grey mist clings to the ground. The few villagers you see look gaunt and fearful."
  - turn: 5
    prompt_injection: "You learn from a desperate villager that the affliction started a month ago, coinciding with strange whispers emanating from the nearby caves. They beg you to investigate."
  - turn: 10 # Entering the caves
    prompt_injection: "You stand at the mouth of the Whispering Caves. A chilling draft carries faint, unsettling whispers that seem to claw at your sanity. The way is dark and foreboding."
  - turn: 15 # Deeper into the caves
    prompt_injection: "The cave system splits into multiple paths. Strange phosphorescent fungi provide a dim, eerie light. The whispers are louder here, more distinct, speaking of forgotten sorrows."
  - turn: 20 # A significant discovery or challenge
    prompt_injection: "You find a large cavern with a crudely carved stone altar at its center. The whispers seem to originate from a pulsating, shadowy crevice behind it."
  - turn: 25 # Approaching the source
    prompt_injection: "The air becomes heavy and charged with an unknown energy. The crevice pulses with a sickening light, and the whispers are now a cacophony of voices, promising power and despair."
  - turn: 29 # Climax
    prompt_injection: "You are at the heart of the curse. The source is before you â€“ a shadowy entity bound to an ancient artifact. It lashes out with tendrils of dark energy."
  - turn: 30 # Resolution
    prompt_injection: |
      The battle is over, the artifact cleansed or destroyed. The oppressive atmosphere in the caves lifts, and the maddening whispers cease.
      You sense that the curse on the village has been broken. Your task here is done.
    force_end_game: true
    # The specifics of "battle is over, artifact cleansed" would be influenced by flags set during events/LLM interactions.
    # The game_loop or get_llm_story_continuation would need to check these flags for a truly dynamic final message.
