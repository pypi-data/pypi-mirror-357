        You carefully sort through the mess on the desk. Beneath a stack of star charts,
        you find what you were looking for: his personal journal. The leather is cool
        to the touch, and a place is marked with a silken ribbon.

        You open the journal to the marked page. Elian's handwriting is frantic.
        'I've found it! The maps were all wrong. It's not in the caves, it's *below*
        them. The entrance is only revealed when the tide is at its lowest. I must see
        it for myself. I will travel to the Saltstone Bluffs at once. The key... the
        key must be the one from the Tycendi ruin.'

        Remembering the journal's mention of a key, you run your hands along the spines
        of the old books on the shelf. One of them, 'A History of Tycendi Ruins', feels
        oddly light. You pull it out and discover it has been hollowed out. Nestled inside
        on a bed of velvet is a heavy, pitted bronze key. It hums with a faint energy.
