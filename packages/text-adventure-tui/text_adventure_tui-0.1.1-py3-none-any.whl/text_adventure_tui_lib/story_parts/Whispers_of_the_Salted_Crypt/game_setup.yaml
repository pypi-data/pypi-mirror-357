        The scent of old paper and dust hangs heavy in the air of your mentor's study.
        Master Elian has been missing for three days. The city guard considers him another
        eccentric old man who simply wandered off, but you know better. His obsession
        was the Salted Crypt, a place of myth that he swore was real. His desk is a
        clutter of maps, books, and unfinished notes. You came here to find a clue,
        any clue, as to where he might have gone.

    # 3. Guide the LLM for its first interaction.

      instruction: "The player is in Master Elian's study. The goal is to find where he went. The most important objects in the room are the cluttered desk, a tall bookshelf filled with lore books, and a large map of the coastline pinned to the wall. Guide the player to investigate these things."
