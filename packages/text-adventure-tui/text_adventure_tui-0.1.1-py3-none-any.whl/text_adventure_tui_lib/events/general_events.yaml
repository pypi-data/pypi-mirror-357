        You step into the bustling town square of Eldoria. Merchants hawk their wares, children laugh and chase pigeons,
        and the scent of freshly baked bread mingles with the metallic tang of the blacksmith's forge.
        A guard near the ornate fountain gives you a nod. "Welcome to Eldoria, traveler. Stay out of trouble."

        While the player is at the inn, they overhear hushed whispers from a nearby table.
        Two grizzled adventurers are talking about strange lights and eerie sounds coming from the old crypts beyond the Whispering Woods.
        This rumor should be subtly woven into the LLM's description of the inn's ambiance or as part of a minor interaction,
        making the player aware of the crypts as a point of interest.
