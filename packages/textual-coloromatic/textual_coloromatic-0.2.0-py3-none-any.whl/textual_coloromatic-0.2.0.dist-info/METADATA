Textual-Color-O-Matic is a [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) library for color animations.

It is designed to make it easy to animate strings with cool color effects.

## Features

- Color system built on Textual's color system. Thus, it can display any color in the truecolor/16-bit spectrum,
and can take common formats such as hex code and RGB, or just a huge variety of named colors.
- Make a gradient automatically between any two colors.
- Animation system that's simple to use. Just make your gradient and toggle it on/off. It can also be started
or stopped in real-time.
- Update the loaded ASCII art in real-time.
- Animation settings can be modified to get different effects. Set a low amount of colors and a low speed for a
very old-school retro look, set it to a high amount of colors and a high speed for a very smooth animation, or
experiment with a blend of these settings.
- Included demo app to showcase the features.
