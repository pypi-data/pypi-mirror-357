</p>


**EvoLib** is a modular and extensible framework for implementing and analyzing evolutionary algorithms in Python.\
It supports classical strategies such as (μ, λ) and (μ + λ) Evolution Strategies, Genetic Algorithms, and Neuroevolution – with a strong focus on clarity, modularity, and didactic value.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Individual- and population-level adaptive mutation strategies
- Modular selection methods: tournament, rank-based, roulette, SUS, truncation, Boltzmann
- Multiple crossover operators: heuristic, arithmetic, differential, SBX, etc.
- Configurable via YAML: clean separation of individual and population setups
- Benchmark functions: Sphere, Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Ackley, Griewank, etc.
- Built-in loss functions (MSE, MAE, Huber, Cross-Entropy)
- Plotting utilities for fitness trends, mutation tracking, diversity
- Designed for extensibility: clean core/operator/utils split
- Sphinx-based documentation (coming soon)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install evolib
```

Requirements: Python 3.9+ and packages in `requirements.txt`.

---

## 🧪 Quickstart Example

```python
from evolib import Pop, Indiv, evolve_mu_lambda, mse_loss, sphere

def fitness(indiv: Indiv) -> None:
    indiv.fitness = mse_loss(0.0, sphere(indiv.para))

pop = Pop(config_path="config/population.yaml")
for _ in range(pop.max_generations):
    evolve_mu_lambda(pop, fitness)
    print(pop)
```

For full examples, see [`examples/`](./examples/) – including plotting, adaptive mutation, and benchmarking.
