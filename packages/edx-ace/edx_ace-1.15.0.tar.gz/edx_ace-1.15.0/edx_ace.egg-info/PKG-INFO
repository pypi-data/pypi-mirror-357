Purpose
*******

The `automated communication engine <https://edx-ace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, A.C.E. for short, is a Django app
for messaging learners on the Open edX platform. This
app can be installed in any Open edX project, but has only been tested with ``edx-platform``. Email delivery
(via Sailthru and Django Email)
are the currently supported delivery channels. In the future we may add support for other delivery channels such as push
notifications.
