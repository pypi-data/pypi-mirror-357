This provides a way to secure your fastapi with keycloak jwt bearer authentication.
This library bases on sag_py_auth and adds support for instances/brands.

## What it does
* Secure your api endpoints
* Verifies auth tokens: signature, expiration, issuer, audience
* Verifies the brand/customer over a token role
* Verifies the instance over a token role
* Verifies the stage over a realm role
* Allows to set additional permissions by specifying further token roles
* Supplies brand information from context

## How to use

### Installation

pip install sag-py-auth-brand

### Secure your apis

First create the fast api dependency with the auth config:
```python
from sag_py_auth import TokenRole
from sag_py_auth_brand.models import AuthConfig
from sag_py_auth_brand.brand_jwt_auth import BrandJwtAuth
from fastapi import Depends

auth_config = BrandAuthConfig("https://authserver.com/auth/realms/projectName", "myaudience", "myinstance", "mystage")
required_roles = [TokenRole("clientname", "adminrole")]
requires_admin = Depends(BrandJwtAuth(auth_config, required_endpoint_roles))
```

Afterwards you can use it in your route like that:

```python
@app.post("/posts", dependencies=[requires_admin], tags=["posts"])
async def add_post(post: PostSchema) -> dict:
```

Or if you use sub routes, auth can also be enforced for the entire route like that:

```python
router = APIRouter()
router.include_router(sub_router, tags=["my_api_tag"], prefix="/subroute",dependencies=[requires_admin])
```

### Get brand information

See sag_py_auth to find out how to access the token and user info.

Furthermore you can get the brand by accessing it over the context:
```python
from sag_py_auth_brand.request_brand_context import get_request_brand as get_brand_from_context
brand = get_brand_from_context()
```

This works in async calls but not in sub threads (without additional changes).

See:
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html
* https://kobybass.medium.com/python-contextvars-and-multithreading-faa33dbe953d

### Log the brand

It is possible to log the brand by adding a filter.

```python
import logging
from sag_py_auth_brand.request_brand_logging_filter import RequestBrandLoggingFilter

console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
console_handler.addFilter(RequestBrandLoggingFilter())

```

The filter provides the field request_brand with the brand.

### How a token has to look like

```json
{

    "iss": "https://authserver.com/auth/realms/projectName",
    "aud": ["audienceOne", "audienceTwo"],
    "typ": "Bearer",
    "azp": "public-project-swagger",
    "preferred_username": "preferredUsernameValue",
    .....
    "realm_access": {
        "roles": ["myStage"]
    },
    "resource_access": {
        "role-instance": {
            "roles": ["myInstance"]
        },
        "role-brand": {
            "roles": ["myBrand"]
        },
        "role-endpoint": {
            "roles": ["permissionOne", "permissionTwo"]
        }
    }
}
```

* role-endpoint is just required for permission checks of the api endpoint

## How to start developing

### With vscode

Just install vscode with dev containers extension. All required extensions and configurations are prepared automatically.

### With pycharm

* Install latest pycharm
* Install pycharm plugin BlackConnect
* Install pycharm plugin Mypy
* Configure the python interpreter/venv
* pip install requirements-dev.txt
* pip install black[d]
* Ctl+Alt+S => Check Tools => BlackConnect => Trigger when saving changed files
* Ctl+Alt+S => Check Tools => BlackConnect => Trigger on code reformat
* Ctl+Alt+S => Click Tools => BlackConnect => "Load from pyproject.yaml" (ensure line length is 120)
* Ctl+Alt+S => Click Tools => BlackConnect => Configure path to the blackd.exe at the "local instance" config (e.g. C:\Python310\Scripts\blackd.exe)
* Ctl+Alt+S => Click Tools => Actions on save => Reformat code
* Restart pycharm

## How to publish

* Update the version in setup.py and commit your change
* Create a tag with the same version number
* Let github do the rest

## How to test

To avoid publishing to pypi unnecessarily you can do as follows

* Tag your branch however you like
* Use the chosen tag in the requirements.txt-file of the project you want to test this library in, eg. `sag_py_auth_brand==<your tag>`
* Rebuild/redeploy your project
