What is ``multiSPAETI``?
========================

``multispaeti`` is a Python implementation of
`MULTISPATI-PCA <https://doi.org/10.3170/2007-8-18312>`_ /
`spatialPCA <https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2008.34>`_.

MULTISPATI-PCA is a dimensionality reduction approach that in comparison to PCA does not
maximize the variance per component but rather the product of variance and Moran's I.
Therefore the eigenvectors with corresponding positive (negative) eigenvalues are
positively (negatively) spatially auto-correlated
