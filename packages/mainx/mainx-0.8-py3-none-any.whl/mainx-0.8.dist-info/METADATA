# BugCheck

**BugCheck** is a Python-based educational utility designed for use in lab environments to collect system data and simulate post-exploitation analysis scenarios. It is used by cybersecurity learners and researchers to study how system-level information can be extracted and analyzed after a compromise.

> ⚠️ This tool is intended **strictly for educational purposes only** in **authorized lab environments**.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

BugCheck performs the following tasks:

- Detects system platform type
- Gathers system and network information (e.g., hostname, IP, user, OS version)
- Demonstrates AES decryption workflows using PBKDF2
- Simulates common behavior seen in threat analysis reports

It does **not** exploit vulnerabilities or modify system settings.
