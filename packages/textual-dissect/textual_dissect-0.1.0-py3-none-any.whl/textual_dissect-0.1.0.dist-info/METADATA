including default CSS and more.

## About

The [Textual documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/) is excellent, but
sometimes you need to dig a bit deeper. I regularly found myself having to dive
into the source code to check the default CSS for widgets.

`textual-dissect` provides quick and easy access to the default CSS and other
inner workings of Textual widgets not covered by the documentation.

## Installation

Install `textual-dissect` using pip:

```
pip install textual-dissect
```
