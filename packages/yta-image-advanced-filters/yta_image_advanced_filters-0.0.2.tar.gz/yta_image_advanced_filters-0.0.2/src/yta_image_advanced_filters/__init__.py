"""
Module to apply filters to images. As simple as
choose the filter available and apply to the
desired image.

This module includes a new 'Image' class that
has the 'filter' functionality to apply the
filters we have available in an easy way.

TODO: Refactor the methods to accept the same
type of 'image' parameter in all of them, being
able ot handle files, pillow, numpy, etc.
