<h1>OpenRecon</h1>
<p>
  <em>Extensible CLI Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment Tool</em>
</p>

> **Note:** This tool is currently in active development. While functional, it may contain bugs as we continue to improve it,Your feedback helps make OpenRecon better! Please report any issues.

## Overview

**OpenRecon** is an extensible, CLI-based reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment tool designed for:
- Security researchers
- Bug bounty hunters
- Penetration testers
- IT security students

This project consolidates multiple scanning techniques into a unified interface to efficiently identify vulnerabilities and surface-level threats.

**Project Background**: This is my final college project and also my first large-scale security tool — built from scratch with passion, learning, and extensive trial and error. Feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!

## Key Features

### Reconnaissance
- **Port Scanning**: Comprehensive `nmap` integration for service detection
- **Host Discovery**:
  - ARP-based scanning for local networks
  - ICMP ping sweep for wide-range detection
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Uses `crt.sh`, DNS resolution with local caching

### Vulnerability Detection
- **XSS Scanner**: Detects reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
- **SQL Injection**: Identifies potential SQLi vulnerabilities
- **CSRF Scanner**: Checks for Cross-Site Request Forgery issues
- **GraphQL Scanner**: Finds exposed GraphQL endpoints
- **CMS Detection**: Fingerprints WordPress, Joomla, and other CMS platforms

## Installation

### Option 1: PyPI Installation
```bash
pip install openrecon
```
#### Troubleshooting PATH Issues
If you get a "command not found" error after installation, it may be because the executable isn’t in your system PATH (especially if using Microsoft Store Python or pip install --user). You may see a warning like:
```bash
WARNING: The script openrecon.exe is installed in 'C:\Users\...\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
```

Quick Fix (works immediately):
```bash
python -m openrecon --help
```

**Permanent Fix — Add to PATH:**
- Copy the Scripts directory path shown in the warning message
- Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and press Enter
- Go to the Advanced tab, and click Environment Variables
- Under User variables, select Path and click Edit
- Click New and paste the Scripts directory path
- Click OK on all dialogs and restart your terminal

### Option 2: Manual Installation
**Linux**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/R0salman/OpenRecon
cd openrecon
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
**Windows**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/R0salman/OpenRecon
cd OpenRecon
setup.bat
```

## Basic Usage
```bash
openrecon --help
openrecon scan --target example.com --flags "-T4 -F"
```
