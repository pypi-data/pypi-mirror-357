# Lightning Module Enhanced

Trying to make pytorch-lightning more *pythonic*, whatever that means.

Docs [here](docs/).

## Installation

```
pip install lightning-module-enhanced
```

Lowest supported python version: 3.10. We have `lightning-module-enhanced==0.34.xxx` that supports python3.8 as well,
but it's not getting updates.
