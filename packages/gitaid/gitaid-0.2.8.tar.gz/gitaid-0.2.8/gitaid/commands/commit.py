"""
A command-line tool that uses LLM to generate Git commit messages 
based on the staged changes. It analyzes the staged diff and produces a 
high-quality, concise commit message summarizing the main changes.

Requirements:
- git
- openai (Python SDK)
- OPENAI_API_KEY

Usage:
    1. Stage your changes using `git add`.
    2. Run this script.
    3. Approve or reject the suggested commit message.
