"""
A utility script that uses LLM to analyze and explain staged Git changes.

Use case:
Ideal for developers who want a quick, AI-generated explanation of what their staged changes are doing,
e.g., for pull requests or code reviews.

Usage:
    1. Stage your changes using `git add`.
    2. Run this script.

Requirements:
    - git
    - openai (Python SDK)
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
