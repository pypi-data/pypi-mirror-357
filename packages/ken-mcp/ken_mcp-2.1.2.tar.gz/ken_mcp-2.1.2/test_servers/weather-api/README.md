## TODO: Implementation Required

This is a boilerplate MCP server generated by KEN-MCP. Claude needs to customize it based on these requirements:

**Original Requirements:**
> Build an MCP that interfaces with weather APIs to provide weather information. It should fetch current weather, forecasts, weather alerts, and historical weather data. The MCP should support multiple locations, different units (metric/imperial), and provide weather-based recommendations. Include functionality to cache API responses and handle rate limiting gracefully.

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update tool names and implementations in `server.py`
- [ ] Implement resource handlers if needed
- [ ] Customize prompt templates
- [ ] Update dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Update this README with actual functionality
- [ ] Test all tools with MCP Inspector

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.10 or higher**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should show Python 3.10+
   ```

2. **pip (Python package installer)**
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

3. **Node.js** (required for npx commands)
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v16 or higher
   npm --version
   ```

If any of these are missing:
- Python: Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Node.js: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this MCP server folder**

2. **Set up environment variables (if needed)**
   ```bash
   cd weather-api
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys and configuration
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Or using a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

### Option 1: Claude Code

Add this server to Claude Code using the CLI:

```bash
# Add as a local project server (recommended for development)
claude mcp add weather-api "python /Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/test_servers/weather-api/server.py"

# Or add as a user server (available across all projects)
claude mcp add weather-api "python /Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/test_servers/weather-api/server.py" --user

# List configured servers to verify
claude mcp list
```

**Important**: Restart Claude Code after adding the server for changes to take effect.

### Option 2: Claude Desktop

1. **Find your configuration file**:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Edit the configuration file** and add your server:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "weather-api": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/test_servers/weather-api/server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   If you already have other servers, add this one to the existing `mcpServers` object:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "existing-server": { ... },
       "weather-api": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/test_servers/weather-api/server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop completely** (quit and reopen)

4. **Verify the server is loaded**: Look for the ðŸ”Œ icon in the bottom of your chat interface

## Testing Your Server

### 1. Test with the included harness
```bash
python test_server.py
```

### 2. Test with MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python server.py
```
This opens an interactive testing interface in your browser.

## Usage

Once configured, you can use your MCP server in Claude:
- Tools will appear in the available tools list
- Resources can be accessed using their URIs
- Prompts will be available as slash commands

## Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in Claude
1. **Verify the server runs without errors**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   It should output: "Server running on stdio"

2. **Check configuration**:
   - Claude Code: Run `claude mcp list` to see configured servers
   - Claude Desktop: Verify the JSON configuration is valid

3. **Restart Claude completely**:
   - Claude Code: Close and reopen the application
   - Claude Desktop: Quit (not just close) and restart

4. **Check logs**:
   - Claude Code: Check terminal output for errors
   - Claude Desktop: Check the logs in the app's developer console

### Common Issues
- **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'"**: Run `pip install -e .` in the project directory
- **"No such file or directory"**: Use absolute paths in configuration
- **Server not updating**: Always restart Claude after configuration changes

## Features (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

### Tools

#### `tool_one`
Primary tool - TODO: Implement based on requirements: Build an MCP that interfaces with weather APIs to provide weather information. It should fetch current weather, forecasts, weather alerts, and historical weather data.
