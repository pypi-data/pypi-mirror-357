## TODO: Implementation Required

This is a boilerplate MCP server generated by KEN-MCP. Claude needs to customize it based on these requirements:

**Original Requirements:**
> Build an MCP that processes files with unicode characters (Ã±, ä¸­æ–‡, emoji ðŸš€), handles very long file paths (>255 chars), manages file permissions, creates nested directories, and performs batch operations on thousands of files. Support CSV, JSON, XML, PDF, and image formats. Process files like "rÃ©sumÃ©_ä¸­æ–‡_ðŸš€.pdf" and paths like /very/long/path/that/exceeds/normal/filesystem/limits/with/unicode/characters/like/æµ‹è¯•/æ–‡ä»¶å¤¹/and/emoji/ðŸš€/in/paths

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Add to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add unicode-file-processor "python /Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/unicode-file-processor/server.py"
```
