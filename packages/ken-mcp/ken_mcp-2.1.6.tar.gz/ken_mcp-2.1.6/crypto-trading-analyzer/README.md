## TODO: Implementation Required

This is a boilerplate MCP server generated by KEN-MCP. Claude needs to customize it based on these requirements:

**Original Requirements:**
> Create an MCP for real-time cryptocurrency trading analysis that connects to WebSocket streams, performs mathematical calculations using NumPy/Pandas, generates charts, sends notifications, maintains a SQLite database, and implements machine learning predictions. Include scheduled tasks and multi-threading. Connect to APIs like Binance, CoinGecko, handle rate limits of 1200 req/min, store data in SQLite with tables for prices, trades, and predictions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Add to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add crypto-trading-analyzer "python /Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/crypto-trading-analyzer/server.py"
```
