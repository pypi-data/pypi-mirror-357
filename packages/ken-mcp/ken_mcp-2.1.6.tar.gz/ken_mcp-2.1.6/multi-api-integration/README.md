## TODO: Implementation Required

This is a boilerplate MCP server generated by KEN-MCP. Claude needs to customize it based on these requirements:

**Original Requirements:**
> Create an MCP that integrates with multiple APIs (GitHub, Slack, Discord) and handles webhook authentication with special characters like quotes, backslashes, and emojis. It should support OAuth2 flows, rate limiting, and error handling with JSON/XML parsing. Use environment variables for API keys and tokens. Handle strings like "test's \"quoted\" content" and paths like C:\Users\Test\file.txt and unicode like ðŸš€ðŸ’»

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Add to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add multi-api-integration "python /Users/kenkai/ClaudeCode/MCP/multi-api-integration/server.py"
```
