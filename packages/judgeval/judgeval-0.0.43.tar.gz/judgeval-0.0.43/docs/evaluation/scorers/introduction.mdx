## Overview

Scorers act as measurement tools for evaluating LLM systems based on specific criteria. 
`judgeval` comes with a set of **10+ built-in scorers** that you can easily start with.

<Tip>
We're always adding new scorers to `judgeval`. If you have a suggestion, please [let us know](mailto:contact@judgmentlabs.ai)!
</Tip>

Scorers execute on `Example`s and `EvalDataset`s, producing a **numerical score**. 
This enables you to **use evaluations as unit tests** by setting a `threshold` to determine whether an evaluation was successful or not. 

## Categories of Scorers
`judgeval` supports three categories of scorers. 
- **Default Scorers**: built-in scorers that are ready to use
- **Custom Scorers**: Powerful scorers that you can tailor to your own LLM system
- **Classifier Scorers**: A special custom scorer that evaluates your LLM system using a natural language criteria

In this section, we'll cover each kind of scorer and how to use them.

### Default Scorers

Most built-in scorers in **`judgeval`** are LLM systems, leveraging advanced prompt engineering to ensure evaluations are flexible, scalable, and aligned closely with human judgment. Each scorer provides transparent reasoning through detailed chains of thought, enabling clear validation of evaluation outcomes.

#### Introducing Osiris

To push the frontier of LLM evaluation further, we've developed **Osiris**, our state-of-the-art hallucination detection system. Created in collaboration with researchers from **Judgment Labs** and the **Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)** under Professor Chris Manning, Osiris integrates leading-edge techniques:

- **Multi-agent system**
- **Test-time scaling**
- **Reinforcement learning**
- **Data augmentation**

These methods allow Osiris to significantly outperform traditional LLM-based evaluation methods—delivering higher accuracy in hallucination detection at substantially lower costs than closed-source models.

We’ll be releasing a report soon detailing some of the novel techniques we’ve developed—stay tuned!

We're actively extending Osiris's innovative techniques to our full suite of default scorers. Soon, you'll benefit from these improvements across all evaluation metrics, enhancing accuracy, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for your entire evaluation workflow.

### Agentic Scorers

Agentic scorers are designed to evaluate multiple steps together within your LLM system—rather than evaluating one step at a time. They are especially useful for multi-step workflows, such as agents, chains, or graphs, where the quality of the overall process matters more than individual outputs.

By grouping related steps into a single evaluation, agentic scorers allow you to:
- Measure end-to-end correctness
- Evaluate goal completion across multiple steps
- Assess coherence and strategy in long chains of reasoning

This makes them ideal for agentic systems, where individual tool calls or LLM responses should be judged as part of a larger goal-oriented behavior.

### Custom Scorers

If you find that none of the default scorers meet your evaluation needs, setting up a custom scorer is easy with `judgeval`.
You can create a custom scorer by inheritng from the `JudgevalScorer` class and implementing three methods:
- `score_example()`: produces a score for a single `Example`.
- `a_score_example()`: async version of `score_example()`. You may use the same implementation logic as `score_example()`.
- `_success_check()`: determines whether an evaluation was successful.

Custom scorers can be as simple or complex as you want, and **do not need to use LLMs**. 
For sample implementations, check out the [Custom Scorers](/evaluation/scorers/custom_scorers) documentation page.


### Classifier Scorers

Classifier scorers are a special type of custom scorer that can evaluate your LLM system using a natural language criteria. 

They either be defined using our judgeval SDK or using the Judgment Platform directly. For more information, check out the [Classifier Scorers](/evaluation/scorers/classifier_scorer) documentation page.

## Running Scorers

All scorers in `judgeval` can be run uniformly through the `JudgmentClient`. All scorers are set to run in async mode by default in order to support parallelized evaluations for large datasets.

```python run_scorer.py
...

client = JudgmentClient()
results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
```
