title: Answer Correctness
description: ""
---

The answer correctness scorer is a default LLM judge scorer that measures how correct/consistent the LLM system's `actual_output` is to the `expected_output`.
In practice, this scorer helps determine whether your LLM application produces **answers that are consistent with golden/ground truth answers**.


## Required Fields

To run the answer relevancy scorer, you must include the following fields in your `Example`:
- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`

## Scorer Breakdown

`AnswerCorrectness` scores are calculated by extracting statements made in the `expected_output` and classifying how many are consistent/correct with respect to the `actual_output`.

The score is calculated as:

$$
\text{correctness score} = \frac{\text{correct statements}}{\text{total statements}}
$$

## Sample Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import AnswerCorrectnessScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
example = Example(
    input="What's your return policy for a pair of socks?",
    # Replace this with your LLM system's output
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!",
    # Replace this with your golden/ground truth answer
    expected_output="Socks can be returned within 30 days of purchase.",
)
# supply your own threshold
scorer = AnswerCorrectnessScorer(threshold=0.8)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
print(results)
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient, ExampleBuilder, AnswerCorrectnessScorer, logger } from 'judgeval';

async function runAnswerCorrectness() {
    const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance();
    const example = new ExampleBuilder()
        .input("What's your return policy for a pair of socks?")
        // Replace this with your LLM system's output
        .actualOutput("We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!")
        // Replace this with your golden/ground truth answer
        .expectedOutput("Socks can be returned within 30 days of purchase.")
        .build();

    // supply your own threshold
    const scorer = new AnswerCorrectnessScorer(0.8);

    const results = await client.evaluate({
        examples: [example],
        scorers: [scorer],
        model: "gpt-4.1",
        projectName: "ans-correct-ts-proj",
        evalName: "ans-correct-ts-eval"
    });
    logger.print(results); // Log results to console
}

runAnswerCorrectness();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `AnswerCorrectness` scorer uses an LLM judge, so you'll receive a reason for the score in the `reason` field of the results. 
This allows you to double-check the accuracy of the evaluation and understand how the score was calculated.
