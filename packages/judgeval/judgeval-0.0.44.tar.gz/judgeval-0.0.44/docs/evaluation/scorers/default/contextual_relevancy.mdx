title: Contextual Relevancy
description: ""
---

The contextual relevancy scorer is a default LLM judge scorer that measures how relevant the contexts in `retrieval_context` are for an `input`. 
In practice, this scorer helps determine whether your RAG pipeline's retriever **effectively retrieves relevant contexts for a query**.

## Required Fields

To run the contextual relevancy scorer, you must include the following fields in your `Example`:
- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Scorer Breakdown

`ContextualRelevancy` scores are calculated by first extracting all statements in `retrieval_context` and then classifying 
which ones are relevant to the `input`.

The score is then calculated as:

$$
\text{Contextual Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Statements}}{\text{Total Number of Statements}}
$$

<Note>
Our contextual relevancy scorer is based on Stanford NLP's [ARES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09476) paper (Saad-Falcon et. al., 2024).

## Sample Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import ContextualRelevancyScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
example = Example(
    input="What's your return policy for a pair of socks?",
    # Replace this with your LLM system's output
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!",
    # Replace this with the contexts retrieved by your RAG retriever
    retrieval_context=["Return policy, all items: 30-day limit for full refund, no questions asked."]
)
# supply your own threshold
scorer = ContextualRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.8)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
print(results)
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient, ExampleBuilder, ContextualRelevancyScorer, logger } from 'judgeval';

async function runContextualRelevancy() {
    const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance();
    const example = new ExampleBuilder()
        .input("What's your return policy for a pair of socks?")
        // Replace this with your LLM system's output
        .actualOutput("We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!")
        // Replace this with the contexts retrieved by your RAG retriever
        .context(["Return policy, all items: 30-day limit for full refund, no questions asked."])
        .build();

    // supply your own threshold
    const scorer = new ContextualRelevancyScorer(0.8);

    const results = await client.evaluate({
        examples: [example],
        scorers: [scorer],
        model: "gpt-4.1",
        projectName: "ctx-relevancy-ts-proj",
        evalName: "ctx-relevancy-ts-eval"
    });
    logger.print(results); // Log results to console
}

runContextualRelevancy();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `ContextualRelevancy` scorer uses an LLM judge, so you'll receive a reason for the score in the `reason` field of the results. 
This allows you to double-check the accuracy of the evaluation and understand how the score was calculated.
