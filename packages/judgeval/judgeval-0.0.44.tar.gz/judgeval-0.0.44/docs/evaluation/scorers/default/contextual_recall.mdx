title: Contextual Recall
description: ""
---

The contextual recall scorer is a default LLM judge scorer that measures whether the `retrieval_context` aligns with the `expected_output`. 
In practice, this scorer helps determine whether your RAG pipeline's retriever is **effectively retrieving relevant contexts**.

<Tip>
There are many factors to consider when evaluating the quality of your RAG pipeline. `judgeval` offers a suite of default scorers to construct a comprehensive 
evaluation of each RAG component. Check out our guide on RAG system evaluation for a deep dive!
</Tip>

## Required Fields

To run the contextual recall scorer, you must include the following fields in your `Example`:
- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Scorer Breakdown

`ContextualRecall` scores are calculated by first determining all statements made in `expected_output`, then classifying which 
statements are backed up by the `retrieval_context`. 

<Note>
This scorer uses the `expected_output` rather than `actual_output` because we're interested in whether the retriever is performing well.
</Note>

The score is calculated as:

$$
\text{Contextual Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Statements in Retrieval Context}}{\text{Number of Relevant Statements in Expected Output}}
$$

<Note>
Our contextual recall scorer is based on Stanford NLP's [ARES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09476) paper (Saad-Falcon et. al., 2024).

## Sample Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import ContextualRecallScorer

client = JudgmentClient()
example = Example(
    input="What's your return policy for a pair of socks?",
    # Replace this with your LLM system's output
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!",
    # Replace this with the ideal output from your RAG generator model
    expected_output="All customers are eligible for a 30-day return policy, no questions asked.",
    # Replace this with the contexts retrieved by your RAG retriever
    retrieval_context=["Return policy, all items: 30-day limit for full refund, no questions asked."]
)
# supply your own threshold
scorer = ContextualRecallScorer(threshold=0.8)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
print(results)
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient, ExampleBuilder, ContextualRecallScorer, logger } from 'judgeval';

async function runContextualRecall() {
    const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance();
    const example = new ExampleBuilder()
        .input("What's your return policy for a pair of socks?")
        // Replace this with your LLM system's output
        .actualOutput("We offer a 30-day return policy for all items, including socks!")
        // Replace this with the ideal output from your RAG generator model
        .expectedOutput("All customers are eligible for a 30-day return policy, no questions asked.")
        // Replace this with the contexts retrieved by your RAG retriever
        .context(["Return policy, all items: 30-day limit for full refund, no questions asked."])
        .build();

    // supply your own threshold
    const scorer = new ContextualRecallScorer(0.8);

    const results = await client.evaluate({
        examples: [example],
        scorers: [scorer],
        model: "gpt-4.1",
        projectName: "ctx-recall-ts-proj",
        evalName: "ctx-recall-ts-eval"
    });
    logger.print(results); // Log results to console
}

runContextualRecall();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `ContextualRecall` scorer uses an LLM judge, so you'll receive a reason for the score in the `reason` field of the results. 
This allows you to double-check the accuracy of the evaluation and understand how the score was calculated.
