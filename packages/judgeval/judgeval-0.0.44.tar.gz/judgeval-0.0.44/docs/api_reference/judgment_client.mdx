title: Judgment Client
---

The `JudgmentClient` is the main interface for interacting with the Judgment API.

## Initializing the Judgment Client

A client can be initialized using an API key and Organization ID. **To receive these credentials**, please sign up at [app.judgmentlabs.ai/register](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register).

Setting the `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables allows you to initialize the client without passing credentials to the constructor/`getInstance` method.

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID="your_org_id"
```

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient

client = JudgmentClient()
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient } from 'judgeval';

// Gets the singleton instance, reading credentials from environment variables
const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance(); 
```
</CodeGroup>

## Running an Evaluation

### Example Level

The `client.run_evaluation` (Python) or `client.evaluate` (Typescript) method is the primary method for executing evaluations.

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer
from judgeval.data import Example

client = JudgmentClient()

example = Example(
    input="What is the capital of France?",  # replace this with your system input
    actual_output="Paris",  # replace this with your LLM's output
    retrieval_context=["France has many cities, including the capital Paris, Lyon, and Marseille."]  # replace this with your RAG contents
)

results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient, ExampleBuilder, FaithfulnessScorer, logger } from 'judgeval';

const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance();

const example = new ExampleBuilder()
    .input("What is the capital of France?") // replace this with your system input
    .actualOutput("Paris") // replace this with your LLM's output
    .context(["France has many cities, including the capital Paris, Lyon, and Marseille."]) // replace this with your RAG contents
    .build();

async function runEval() {
    const results = await client.evaluate({
        examples: [example],
        scorers: [new FaithfulnessScorer(0.5)],
        model: "gpt-4.1",
        projectName: "client-api-ref-proj", // Optional: Provide a project name
        evalName: "client-api-ref-eval"   // Optional: Provide an eval name
    });
    logger.print(results);
}

runEval();
```
</CodeGroup>

The `run_evaluation` (Python) / `evaluate` (Typescript) method accepts the following arguments/options:
- `examples`: A list/array of [Example](/evaluation/data_examples) objects to evaluate.
- `model`: The model to use for the evaluation, such as `gpt-4.1` or `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-Turbo`.
- `scorers`: A list/array of [Scorer](/evaluation/scorers) objects to use for the evaluation.
- `log_results` (Python) / `logResults` (Typescript): Whether to log the results of the evaluation to the Judgment platform. Defaults to `true`.
- `override`: Whether to override an existing evaluation with the same name. Defaults to `false`.
- `append`: Whether to append the results of the evaluation to an existing evaluation with the same name. Defaults to `False`.
- `project_name` (Python) / `projectName` (Typescript): The name of the project to use for the evaluation. Defaults to `"default_project"`.
- `eval_run_name` (Python) / `evalName` (Typescript): The name of the evaluation run. Defaults to `"default_eval_run"`.
- `async_execution` (Python) / `asyncExecution` (Typescript): Whether to run the evaluation asynchronously. Defaults to `false`.
- `rules` (Typescript only): An array of [Rule](/alerts/rules) objects to associate with the evaluation.
- `metadata` (Typescript only): Additional metadata for the evaluation run.
- `aggregator` (Typescript only): Aggregator function name.
- `ignoreErrors` (Typescript only): Whether to ignore errors during evaluation. Defaults to `true`.

<Tip>
In Judgment, **projects** are used to organize workflows, while **evaluation runs** 
are used to group versions of a workflow for comparative analysis of evaluations. 
As a result, you can think of projects as folders, and evaluation runs as sub-folders that contain evaluation results.
</Tip>


### Sequence Level

The `client.run_sequence_evaluation` (Python) or `client.evaluateSequence` (Typescript) method is the primary method for executing sequence evaluations.

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example, Sequence
from judgeval.scorers import DerailmentScorer

client = JudgmentClient()

airlines_example = Example(
    input="Which airlines fly to Paris?",
    actual_output="Air France, Delta, and American Airlines offer direct flights."
)
airline_followup = Example(
    input="Which airline is the best for a family of 4?",
    actual_output="Delta is the best airline for a family of 4."
)
weather_example = Example(
    input="What is the weather like in Texas?",
    actual_output="It's sunny with a high of 75Â°F in Texas."
)
airline_sequence = Sequence(
    name="Flight Details",
    items=[airlines_example, airline_followup, weather_example]
)

results = client.run_sequence_evaluation(
    sequences=[airline_sequence],
    scorers=[DerailmentScorer(threshold=0.5)],
    model="gpt-4.1",
    log_results=True,
    override=True,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

The `run_sequence_evaluation` (Python) / `evaluateSequence` (Typescript) method accepts the same arguments as the `run_evaluation` (Python) / `evaluate` (Typescript) method, with the following changes to the arguments:

- `sequences`: A list/array of [Sequence](/evaluation/data_examples) objects to evaluate (instead of 'examples')
