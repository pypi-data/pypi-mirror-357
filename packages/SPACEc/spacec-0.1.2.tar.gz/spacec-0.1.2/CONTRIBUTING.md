# Contributing

Welcome to `SPACEc` contributor's guide.

This document focuses on getting any potential contributor familiarized with the development processes, but [other kinds of contributions] are also appreciated.

If you are new to using [git] or have never collaborated in a project previously, please have a look at [contribution-guide.org]. Other resources are also  listed in the excellent [guide created by FreeCodeCamp] [^contrib1].

Please notice, all users and contributors are expected to be **open,
considerate, reasonable, and respectful**. When in doubt,
[Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct] is a good reference in terms of
behavior guidelines.

## Issue Reports

If you experience bugs or general issues with `SPACEc`, please have a look on the [issue tracker]. If you don't see anything useful there, please feel free to fire an issue report.

```{tip}
Please don't forget to **include the closed issues in your search**.
Sometimes a solution was already reported, and the problem is considered
**solved**.
```

New issue reports should include information about your programming environment
(e.g., operating system, Python version) and steps to reproduce the problem.
Please try also to simplify the reproduction steps to a very minimal example that still illustrates the problem you are facing. By removing other factors, you help us to identify the root cause of the issue.

## Documentation Improvements

You can help improve `SPACEc` docs by making them more readable and coherent, or by adding missing information and correcting mistakes.

### Docstrings

The most important way to contribute to our documentation is completing missing docstrings.

> We are using [`numpy` style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).

If you see differently styled docstrings feel free to change them.
The updated docstrings will automatically be integrated into our [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com) documentation.

### Tutorials

Tutorial notebooks are imported from `notebooks`.
Please always start a notebook with a main header, e.g., `# EXAMPLE HEADER`.

### Read the Docs

`SPACEc` documentation uses [Sphinx] as its main documentation compiler which helps us to automatically push our documentation to [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com).
This means that the docs are kept in the same repository as the project code, and that any documentation update is done in the same way was a code contribution.

> We are using Markdown with the [MyST] extension for our documentations.

```{tip}
See [MyST] on how to get started writing documentation files,
and install an editor extensions (e.g., [MyST-Markdown for VS Code]) for easier editing.
It can also make sense to have a look at the [Sphinx] documentation for more advanced editing.
```

```{tip}
   Please notice that the [GitHub web interface] provides a quick way of
   propose changes in `SPACEc`'s files. While this mechanism can
   be tricky for normal code contributions, it works perfectly fine for
   contributing to the docs, and can be quite handy.

   If you are interested in trying this method out, please navigate to
   the `docs` folder in the source [repository], find which file you
   would like to propose changes and click in the little pencil icon at the
   top, to open [GitHub's code editor]. Once you finish editing the file,
   please write a message in the form at the bottom of the page describing
   which changes have you made and what are the motivations behind them and
   submit your proposal.
```

When working on documentation changes in your local machine, you can
compile them using [tox] :

```bash
tox -e docs
```

```{tip}
If you are running within a `conda` environment
first install `tox` with `conda install tox`.
```

and use Python's built-in web server for a preview in your web browser
(`http://localhost:8000`):

```bash
python3 -m http.server --directory 'docs/_build/html'
```

## Code Contributions

### Submit an issue

Before you work on any non-trivial code contribution it's best to first create
a report in the [issue tracker] to start a discussion on the subject.
This often provides additional considerations and avoids unnecessary work.

### Quickstart

```{note} **Conventions:**
- `numpy` style docstrings
- [MyST] documentation using [Sphinx]
```

```{note} **Tutorials:**
Tutorial notebooks are imported from `notebooks`.
Please always start a notebook with a main header, e.g., `# EXAMPLE HEADER`.
```

```bash
# setup virtual environment
conda create -n SPACEc python=3.10 pytest pytest-cov tox pre-commit
conda activate SPACEc

# clone and install SPACEc
git clone git@github.com:yuqiyuqitan/SPACEc.git
cd SPACEc
pip install -e .

# for Apple Mx users, additional steps might be necessary
# also see `README.md`
# conda install tensorflow=2.10.0

# install pre-commit hooks (for automatic style checks)
pre-commit install

# try to run tests
tox

# build and look at docs
tox -e docs
python3 -m http.server --directory 'docs/_build/html'
```



### Create an environment

Before you start coding, we recommend creating an isolated [virtual environment]
to avoid any problems with your installed Python packages.
We strongly recommend using some `conda`-style environment mangement  system,
e.g., [Miniconda]:

```bash
# create conda environment
conda create -n SPACEc python=3.10 pytest pytest-cov tox
conda activate SPACEc
```

```{tip}
Please also see the [Overview] for the most up to date instruction son how to set up the environment to use and develop `SPACEc`.
```

### Clone the repository

1. Create an user account on GitHub if you do not already have one.

2. Fork the project [repository]: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on GitHub.

3. Clone this copy to your local disk:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:yuqiyuqitan/SPACEc.git
   cd SPACEc
   ```

4. You should run:

   ```
   pip install -U pip setuptools -e .
   ```

   to be able to import the package under development in the Python REPL.

5. Install [pre-commit]:

   ```
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

   `SPACEc` comes with a lot of hooks configured to automatically help the
   developer to check the code being written.

### Implement your changes

1. Create a branch to hold your changes:

   ```
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   and start making changes. Never work on the main branch!

2. Start your work on this branch. Don't forget to add [docstrings] to new
   functions, modules and classes, especially if they are part of public APIs.
   **Please use `numpy` style docstrings.**

3. Add yourself to the list of contributors in `AUTHORS.md`.

4. When youâ€™re done editing, do:

   ```
   git add <MODIFIED FILES>
   git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in [git].

   Please make sure to see the validation messages from [pre-commit] and fix
   any eventual issues.
   This should automatically use [flake8]/[black] to check/fix the code style
   in a way that is compatible with the project.

   :::{important}
   Don't forget to add unit tests and documentation in case your
   contribution adds an additional feature and is not just a bugfix.

   Moreover, writing a [descriptive commit message] is highly recommended.
   In case of doubt, you can check the commit history with:

   ```
   git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all
   ```

   to look for recurring communication patterns.
   :::

5. Please check that your changes don't break any unit tests with:

   ```
   tox
   ```

   (after having installed [tox] with
   `conda install tox`, `pip install tox` or `pipx`).

   You can also use [tox] to run several other pre-configured tasks in the
   repository. Try `tox -av` to see a list of the available checks.

### Submit your contribution

1. If everything works fine, push your local branch to the remote server with:

   ```
   git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

2. Go to the web page of your fork and click "Create pull request"
   to send your changes for review.

   Find more detailed information in [creating a PR]. You might also want to open
   the PR as a draft first and mark it as ready for review after the feedbacks
   from the continuous integration (CI) system or any required fixes.

   Pull requests automatically trigger tests via Github Actions.
   We can only merge a pull request if all tests succeed.

```{tip}
Every now and then Github Actions has a hick up and tests fail due to random reasons.
For example saying `THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE.`
You can make a small change and commit to update your pull request
and trigger a re-run of the tests.
```

### Troubleshooting

The following tips can be used when facing problems to build or test the
package:

1. Make sure to fetch all the tags from the upstream [repository].
   The command `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags` should return the version you
   are expecting. If you are trying to run CI scripts in a fork repository,
   make sure to push all the tags.
   You can also try to remove all the egg files or the complete egg folder, i.e.,
   `.eggs`, as well as the `*.egg-info` folders in the `src` folder or
   potentially in the root of your project.

2. Sometimes [tox] misses out when new dependencies are added, especially to
   `setup.cfg` and `docs/requirements.txt`. If you find any problems with
   missing dependencies when running a command with [tox], try to recreate the
   `tox` environment using the `-r` flag. For example, instead of:

   ```
   tox -e docs
   ```

   Try running:

   ```
   tox -r -e docs
   ```

3. Make sure to have a reliable [tox] installation that uses the correct
   Python version (e.g., 3.7+). When in doubt you can run:

   ```
   tox --version
   # OR
   which tox
   ```

   If you have trouble and are seeing weird errors upon running [tox], you can
   also try to create a dedicated [virtual environment] with a [tox] binary
   freshly installed.

4. [Pytest can drop you] in an interactive session in the case an error occurs.
   In order to do that you need to pass a `--pdb` option (for example by
   running `tox -- -k <NAME OF THE FALLING TEST> --pdb`).
   You can also setup breakpoints manually instead of using the `--pdb` option.

## Maintainer tasks

### Releases

If you are part of the group of maintainers and have correct user permissions
on [PyPI], the following steps can be used to release a new version for
`SPACEc`:

1. Make sure all unit tests are successful.
2. Tag the current commit on the main branch with a release tag, e.g., `v1.2.3`.
3. Push the new tag to the upstream [repository],
   e.g., `git push upstream v1.2.3`
4. This will automatically start a Github Action to deploy the new version to [PyPI]
   and update the documentation on [Read the Docs].

<!-- Clean up the dist and build folders with tox -e clean (or rm -rf dist build) to avoid confusion with old builds and Sphinx docs.

Run tox -e build and check that the files in dist have the correct version (no .dirty or git hash) according to the git tag. Also check the sizes of the distributions, if they are too big (e.g., > 500KB), unwanted clutter may have been accidentally included.

Run tox -e publish -- --repository pypi and check that everything was uploaded to PyPI correctly. -->

[^contrib1]: Even though, these resources focus on open source projects and
    communities, the general ideas behind collaborating with other developers
    to collectively create software are general and can be applied to all sorts
    of environments, including private companies and proprietary code bases.
