# Summary

Managing forest ecosystems effectively requires long-term foresight into global wood
markets. This planning relies on macroeconomic panel data spanning multiple countries
over extended time periods. The cobwood package introduces a data structure to
manipulate panel data for forecasting and scenario analysis. By implementing country and
time indexes, the package improves model readability, as the source code closely mirrors
mathematical equations used in research publications. To demonstrate cobwood's practical
application, we present a reimplementation of the Global Forest Products Model (GFPMx).
Our data structure leverages the Xarray package, which provides labeled N-dimensional
arrays and robust capabilities including NetCDF file storage for model outputs. This
approach offers two key advantages: enhanced source code clarity that facilitates model
inspection, and comprehensive metadata for country, product, and time coordinates along
with units metadata in the dataset attributes. These features position cobwood as an
ideal component for integration into broader modeling toolchains.


# Statement of need

Forest management requires a long-term perspective, as trees mature over decades or
centuries, while wood markets operate on a global scale. Decision makers in the forestry
sector need reliable long-term forecasts of global consumption and trade patterns for
forest products to manage ecosystems effectively. They particularly value the ability to
explore potential future wood harvest developments under various demand and supply
scenarios. This need has prompted forest economists to develop macroeconomic models of
the forest sector. Several global forest sector models currently exist, including the
Global Forest Products Model (GFPM)[@buongiorno2003global], the European Forest
Institute Global Trade Model (EFI-GTM)[@kallio2004global], the Global Forest and
Agriculture Model (G4M)[@gusti2020g4m], and the Global Forest Trade Model (GFTM)
[@jonsson2015global]. Variants such as Timba (a GFPM adaptation) [@tifsm2025] complement
numerous regional and national models. Model transparency is crucial for determining
whether a particular model is suitable for analyzing specific policy questions or can be
appropriately modified for new purposes. While research papers provide the conceptual
foundation for these models, reading the source code of the model implementation offers
a more comprehensive understanding of the modeling system. Detailed knowledge on the
source code implementation of a model becomes essential when extending a model to
address novel research questions.

Macroeconomic forest sector models typically organize market datasets along two key
dimensions: country and time. In econometrics, this structure is known as panel data.
These market datasets contain information on production, consumption, and trade for
specific forest products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp, and paper
products. Current modeling software often lacks a consistent, well-labeled panel data
structure. Instead, these programs use partial labeling approachesâ€”such as matrices
names or vector names within data frames, or simple column names in spreadsheets. While
this approach can make programs more concise, it creates challenges for newcomers trying
to understand the models. Variable names are often unclear, and the limited data
labeling makes the code difficult to interpret for those unfamiliar with the specific
implementation. Examples of readability issue can be found in the source code of models
like GFTM, GFPM, and Timba. That source code for other forest sector models, such as
EFI-GTM and G4M-GLOBIOM-Forest, is not yet publicly available for review.

The cobwood model has been used to produce scenario analysis for technical reports
@mubareka2025 and @rougieux2024. The first model programmed inside cobwood is only a
reimplementation of an existing model, the main value of this python package doesn't lie
in the model itself, but in the panel data structure that can be used to implement many
models.

The next sections describe input output data and the data structure.


# Input, output

Cobwood can process **input** data from any tabular source that Python supports. For
instance, the GFPMx model uses a single Excel spreadsheet containing separate sheets for
consumption, production, import, export, and prices of major forest products from
FAOSTAT. The implementation first converts these sheets to CSV files, which the
gfpmx_data.py module then transforms into an Xarray data structure. Remember that Xarray
datasets can be converted to pandas data frame very easily.

**Output** data is saved in NetCDF format, which serves as Xarray's disk representation.
While not commonly used in economics, this format is standard in earth systems modeling,
making it ideal for integrated modeling systems where economic and biophysical models
exchange data. The `write_datasets_to_netcdf` method adds a third dimension coordinate
called "product" before saving datasets to NetCDF files. These files include metadata
labels for units, establishing a foundation for reproducible analysis across research
teams.

data"){#fig:structure}

# Data structure and implementation

Cobwood leverages Xarray's labeled data arrays to represent panel data, enabling a more
intuitive approach to economic modeling. This design allows developers to write Python
functions that closely mirror the mathematical equations found in academic literature,
with explicit time and country dimensions. The package is designed for extensibility
across different models, though the initial release focuses on implementing the Global
Forest Products Model (GFPMx) [@buongiorno2021gfpmx]. The core of cobwood is the GFPMX
object, which organizes global forest product data including consumption, production,
trade flows, and prices.

Data organization follows a logical hierarchy:

- Each forest product is stored as a separate Xarray dataset (e.g., gfpmx["sawn"] for
  sawnwood)
- Within each product dataset, specific variables are accessible as two-dimensional
  arrays (e.g., gfpmx["sawn"]["cons"] for consumption)
- These arrays maintain panel data structure with clear country and year dimensions
- Some variables, like demand elasticities, use only the country dimension

To explore available variables and their units for any product, users can access the
`variables` property (e.g., `gfpmxb2021["sawn"].variables`). For example this prints the
unit used by the roundwood product for the production variable:

```
gfpmxb2021["indround"]["prod"].unit
# '1000m3'
```

A key advantage of Xarray's approach is the automatic dimension alignment when
performing operations between arrays, which simplifies mathematical operations across
different data elements. As Figure \ref{fig:structure} illustrates, the labeled
panel data structure
creates a clean, organized data representation that makes the modeling system more
accessible to new users.


# Model run

Load the input data into a GFPMX model object. The `rerun=True` argument gives the
instruction to erase previous model runs of this scenario. When running the model,
`compare=True` argument makes it compare the model output with a reference model run
from the external model that we use as a reference in this case the Excel implementation
of GFPMx:

    from cobwood.gfpmx import GFPMX
    gfpmxb2021 = GFPMX(scenario="base_2021", rerun=True)
    gfpmxb2021.run(compare=True, strict=False)

After a model run, the scenario output data is automatically saved inside the model's
`output_dir` directory. When re-loading the model later, specify the argument
`rerun="False"` (default) to load both input and output data without the need to run the
model.


# Visualisation

The following python code draws a faceted plot of industrial roundwood
consumption, import, export, production and price. We don't need to re-run the model
this time since we can simply reload the model's output data from the previous run
above.

```
from cobwood.gfpmx import GFPMX
gfpmxb2021 = GFPMX(scenario="base_2021", rerun=False)
```

The first plot draws coloured lines by continents. It is the default plot.

```
gfpmxb2021.facet_plot_by_var("indround")
```

![Industrial roundwood variables by continent](fig/indround_by_continent.png "Plot of
industrial roundwood variables by
continent")

The country argument can specify one coloured line by country:

    gfpmxb2021.facet_plot_by_var("indround", countries=["Canada", "France", "Japan"])

![Industrial roundwood variables by country](fig/indround_by_country.png "Plot of
industrial roundwood variables by
country")

Plots are visible in the model's output directory `gfpmxb2021.output_dir`. Since the
method returns a plot object, the output of the `facet_plot_by_var()` method can also be
displayed in a Jupyter notebook directly.

The following code draws a plot of Forest area and forest stock.

    gfpmxb2021.facet_plot_by_var("indround", countries=["Canada", "France", "Japan"])

Xarray objects also have a plot method which provides built-in visualisation
capabilities.

<!-- Save plots as images to be inserted in the paper

    from cobwood import data_dir
    from cobwood.gfpmx_equations import compute_country_aggregates
    plot_dir = data_dir.parent / "cobwood/paper/fig"
    gfpmxb2021 = GFPMX(
        input_dir="gfpmx_base2021", base_year=2021, scenario="base_2021",
        rerun=False
    )
    print("Re-compute aggregates for the historical period.")
    for this_product in gfpmxb2021.products:
        for year in range(1995, 2022):
            compute_country_aggregates(gfpmxb2021[this_product], year)
            compute_country_aggregates(gfpmxb2021.other, year, ["area", "stock"])

    # Draw the default plot with one line by continent
    g = gfpmxb2021.facet_plot("indround")
    g.savefig(plot_dir / "indround_by_continent.png")

    # Use the countries argument to specify one line by country
    g = gfpmxb2021.facet_plot("indround", countries=["Canada", "France", "Japan"])
    g.savefig(plot_dir / "indround_by_country.png")

# Conclusion

The cobwood package introduces a new way to represent macroeconomic forest products
market data using N-dimensional labeled data arrays. This data structure, built on
Xarray, improves source code readability by allowing equations with time and country
coordinates to be easily identified in the code. Units are stored as metadata attributes
within the data structure. Model outputs are saved to NetCDF files, which preserve
Xarrayâ€™s data model, including dimensions and attributes. We believe this new structure
makes Cobwood an excellent foundation for implementing various forest sector models.
Additionally, the scenario configuration file enables easy comparison of multiple model
implementations across a wide range of configuration parameters. # References
