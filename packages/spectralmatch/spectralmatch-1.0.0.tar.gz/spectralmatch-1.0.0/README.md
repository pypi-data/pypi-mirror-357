## Overview

![Global and Local Matching](./images/spectralmatch.png)

*spectralmatch* provides a Python library, command line interface, and QGIS plugin with multiple algorythms to perform Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN). It also includes utilities for generating seamlines, cloud masks, Pseudo-Invariant Features, statistics, preprocessing, and more.

## Features

- **Automated, Efficient, and Scalable:** Designed for large-scale workflows with no manual steps, leveraging multiprocessing and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF support for fast, efficient processing across images, windows, and bands. 

- **Resumable Processing:** Save image stats and block maps for quicker reprocessing.

- **Integrated Seamline and Cloud Masking:** Generate seamlines and detect clouds within the same workflow.

- **Specify Model Images** Include all or specified images in the matching solution to bring all images to a central tendency or selected images spectral profile.

- **Consistent Multi-image Analysis:** Performs minimal necessary adjustments to achieve inter-image consistency while preserving the original spectral characteristics.

- **Sensor and Unit Agnostic:** Supports optical imagery from handheld cameras, drones, crewed aircraft, and satellites for reliable single sensor and multi-sensor analysis, while preserving spectral integrity across all pixel unitsâ€”including negative values and reflectance.

- **Enhanced Imagery:** Helpful when performing mosaics and time series analysis by blending large image collections and normalizing them over time, providing consistent, high-quality data for machine learning and other analytical tasks.

- **Open Source and Collaborative:** Free under the MIT License with a modular design that supports community contributions and easy development of new features and workflows. Accessible through a python library, command line interface, and QGIS plugin.

## Current Matching Algorithms

### Global to local matching
This technique is derived from 'An auto-adapting global-to-local color balancing method for optical imagery mosaic' by Yu et al., 2017 (DOI: 10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.08.002). It is particularly useful for very high-resolution imagery (satellite or otherwise) and works in a two phase process.
First, this method applies least squares regression to estimate scale and offset parameters that align the histograms of all images toward a shared spectral center. This is achieved by constructing a global model based on the overlapping areas of adjacent images, where the spectral relationships are defined. This global model ensures that each image conforms to a consistent radiometric baseline while preserving overall color fidelity.
However, global correction alone cannot capture intra-image variability so a second local adjustment phase is performed. The overlap areas are divided into smaller blocks, and each blockâ€™s mean is used to fine-tune the color correction. This block-wise tuning helps maintain local contrast and reduces visible seams, resulting in seamless and spectrally consistent mosaics with minimal distortion.

#### Assumptions

- **Consistent Spectral Profile:** The true spectral response of overlapping areas remains the same throughout the images.

- **Least Squares Modeling:** A least squares approach can effectively model and fit all images' spectral profiles.

- **Scale and Offset Adjustment:** Applying scale and offset corrections can effectively harmonize images.

- **Minimized Color Differences:** The best color correction is achieved when color differences are minimized.

- **Geometric Alignment:** Images are assumed to be geometrically aligned with known relative positions via a geotransform. However, they only need to be roughly aligned as pixel co-registration is not required.

- **Global Consistency:** Overlapping color differences are consistent across the entire image.

- **Local Adjustments:** Block-level color differences result from the global application of adjustments.
