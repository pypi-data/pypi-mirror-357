MLflow sweep is a simple extension to the MLflow framework for running hyperparameter sweeps. In particular, it adds
the following functionality compared to running MLflow experiments directly:

- **Sweep configuration**: Define a sweep configuration file that specifies the command to run, the parameters to
    sweep over, and the sweep strategy. Support for multiple sweep strategies (grid search, random) and different
    parameter distributions (categorical, uniform, normal, log uniform).

- **No code change**: No changes to your code are required to run sweeps. You can use the same code you would use for
    running a single experiment.

- **Auto grouping**: Automatically groups runs by sweep name, making it easy to track and compare results.

- **Visualization**: Provides custom visualizations for sweep results, including parameter importance and performance
    metrics.

The package was heavily inspired by the sweep functionality of Weights & Biases and aims to provide a similar
experience for MLflow users. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing MLflow workflows.

## üîß Installation

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install mlflow-sweep
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv add mlflow-sweep
    ```

And that's it. You should now be able to see an additional `sweep` command in the MLflow CLI.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development setup

Mlflow sweep uses [uv](https://uv.dev) for development and packaging. To set up the development environment run the
following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlflow_sweep
cd mlflow_sweep

# Install using uv with development dependencies
uv sync --dev
```

py-[invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) is used for running common tasks, such as running tests, building the package,
and generating documentation.

```txt
‚ùØ uv run invoke --list
Available tasks:

    all        Run all tasks.
    check      Check code with pre-commit.
    clean      Clean up build artifacts.
    docs       Build the documentation.
    doctests   Run doctests.
    tests      Test and coverage.
