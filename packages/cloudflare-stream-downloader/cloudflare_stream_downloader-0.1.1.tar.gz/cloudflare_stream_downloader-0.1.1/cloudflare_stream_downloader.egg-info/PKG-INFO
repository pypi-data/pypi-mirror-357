Cloudflare Stream Video Downloader
A simple and easy-to-use Python script for downloading videos from Cloudflare Stream. This tool automatically checks for and attempts to install FFmpeg (on Windows and Linux), then converts Cloudflare Stream video links into downloadable .mp4 files.

‚ú® Features
Automatic FFmpeg Management: Automatically detects if FFmpeg is installed on the system and attempts to download and install it on Windows and major Linux distributions.

Cloudflare Stream URL Conversion: Converts Cloudflare Stream URLs in thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg format to manifest/video.m3u8 format, which is suitable for FFmpeg download.

Video Download: Uses FFmpeg to download videos and saves them in .mp4 format.

Download Progress Display: Shows real-time FFmpeg progress output during the download.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

FFmpeg (The tool will attempt to install it for you automatically; if it fails, you may need to install it manually)
