# CipherDropX – h_parser.py
# =========================
#
# This module is part of CipherDropX, a Python implementation that
# deciphers the streaming signatures used by YouTube (both modern and
# legacy player builds).

# ----------------------
# 1.  The code below remains bit-for-bit identical to the authoritative
#     source committed by the maintainer. Only documentation has been added.
# 2.  No Markdown emphasis markers are used in this docstring to keep plain

# 3.  Detailed design discussions live in the project wiki; this header
#     provides a concise overview so you can jump into the source with
#     confidence.
#
# High-level overview
# -------------------
# *   Purpose        : Extract H‑table used in obfuscated method access
# *   Entry point    : First step in the modern deciphering path
# *   Output         : List of method names (e.g., "split", "splice", ...)
# *   Usage          : Passed to regex templates for transformation detection
# *   Execution core : Enables parser.py to detect helper mappings by index
#
# Module description
# ------------------
# This module is responsible for extracting the H-table — a lookup array
# encoded as a single giant string in YouTube’s base.js. This string,
# typically split using a custom delimiter (e.g., `{`), contains method names
# like "split", "splice", "reverse", and "join", which are later accessed by
# numeric indices (e.g., H[30]).
#
# Because YouTube obfuscates all method references in recent player builds,
# recovering the H-table is a prerequisite for detecting transformation
# helpers in the decipher routine.
#
# Once extracted, the H-table is passed into regex.py, which generates
# regexes using its method-to-index mappings, enabling precise function
# detection despite heavy obfuscation.
#
# Guarantee
# ---------
# The extraction method is robust to variation in delimiters and naming;
# it is designed to match the structural pattern of obfuscated player builds.
#
# This header augments documentation only; executable code remains unchanged.
#
# Feel free to open issues or pull requests at the GitHub repository above
# if you have improvement ideas.
