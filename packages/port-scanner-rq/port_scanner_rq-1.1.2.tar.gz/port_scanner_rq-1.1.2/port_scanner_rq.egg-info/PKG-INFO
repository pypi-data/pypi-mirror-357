# 🔍 port_scanner

A fast and lightweight multi-threaded TCP port scanner in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- High-speed port scanning
- Adjustable thread count and timeout
- Customizable port range
- No external dependencies (uses only `socket`, `threading` and `time`)
- Performance timing

## 🧠 How It Works

Each thread scans ports in a staggered manner using `socket.connect_ex()`. Results are appended safely using threading locks.
