"""This module contains all the low level actions used to control a Tracks object.
Low level actions should control these aspects of Tracks:
    - adding/removing nodes and edges to/from the segmentation and graph
    - Updating the segmentation and graph attributes that are controlled by the segmentation.
    Currently, position and area for nodes, and IOU for edges.
    - Keeping track of information needed to undo the given action. For removing a node,
    this means keeping track of the incident edges that were removed, along with their
    attributes.

The low level actions do not contain application logic, such as manipulating track ids,
or validation of "allowed" actions.
The actions should work on candidate graphs as well as solution graphs.
Action groups can be constructed to represent application-level actions constructed
from many low-level actions.
