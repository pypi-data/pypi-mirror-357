# Contributing to Letta MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Letta MCP Server! This project represents the first production-ready bridge between Claude's MCP ecosystem and Letta's stateful agents, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## üéØ Project Vision

Our mission is to democratize access to stateful AI agents by providing seamless integration between Claude and Letta.ai. We believe that powerful AI capabilities should be accessible to all developers, not just those working with specific platforms.

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or for Python development
   pip install -e ".[dev]"

   npm test
   # or
   pytest
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**

## üé® Coding Standards

### Code Style

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- Use Prettier for formatting (config provided)
- Follow ESLint rules (config provided)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer async/await over promises

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting
- Type hints required for public APIs
- Docstrings for all public functions

### API Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
2. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes
3. **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented with examples
4. **Testing**: New features require corresponding tests
5. **Performance**: Consider memory usage and response times

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description if needed, explaining what changed and why.

Fixes #123
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Example Commit Messages

```
feat(api): add streaming support for agent conversations

Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time conversation streaming.
This enables more responsive user experiences in Claude when interacting
with Letta agents.

Fixes #45
```

```
fix(auth): handle expired API keys gracefully

Previously, expired Letta API keys would cause server crashes. Now we
catch authentication errors and return proper HTTP 401 responses with
helpful error messages.

Fixes #67
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests**
- Individual function and method testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 100ms per test)
- High coverage requirements (>90%)

**Integration Tests**
- End-to-end MCP tool functionality
- Real Letta API interactions (test environment)
- Claude MCP client integration
- Network and timeout handling

**Performance Tests**
- Response time benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent request handling
- Rate limit compliance

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Tests should be deterministic and reliable
- Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/agent-management.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```
