## Recommended Approach: Option 2

**Rationale:**
- **Berkeley Connection**: Establishes common ground through shared Berkeley AI ecosystem
- **Technical Relevance**: Demonstrates understanding of Letta's core value proposition
- **Specific Achievement**: Mentions the concrete deliverable (first MCP server)
- **Value Proposition**: Clear benefit to Letta's mission of democratizing agent development
- **Professional Tone**: Respectful and collaborative rather than sales-focused

## Follow-up Message Strategy

**Follow-up Message:**

Thanks for connecting, Charles! 

I've been following Letta's journey since the MemGPT paper went viral - fascinating to see the transition from research to production platform. 

We just open-sourced the first MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Letta.ai, which enables Claude Desktop/Code users to create, manage, and interact with Letta agents directly through native MCP tools. It includes 30+ endpoints covering the full Letta API with streaming support and production-grade error handling.

The goal is expanding access to stateful agents beyond the ADE to the broader Claude ecosystem (millions of users). Early feedback suggests this could significantly increase Letta adoption among developers already using Claude for AI development.

Would love to share the technical details and explore potential collaboration - happy to set up a brief call if you're interested in seeing how this integration works.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Additional Connection Strategies

### Alternative Platforms
1. **Twitter/X**: Engage with Charles's tweets about AI agents and memory systems
2. **GitHub**: Star/contribute to Letta repositories and reference in commit messages
3. **Conference Events**: Connect at AI systems conferences (NSDI, ICML, etc.)
4. **Academic Networks**: Reach out through Berkeley AI Research connections

### Timing Considerations
- **Best Times**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM PST (Charles likely in SF/Berkeley time zone)
- **Avoid**: Weekends, major conference weeks, holidays
- **Optimal**: Post major Letta announcements when engagement is high

### Value-First Approach
- **Technical Contribution**: Demonstrate value through open-source contribution
- **Community Building**: Engage with Letta community discussions
- **Thought Leadership**: Share insights on MCP + stateful agents integration
- **Partnership Mindset**: Focus on mutual benefit rather than one-sided ask
