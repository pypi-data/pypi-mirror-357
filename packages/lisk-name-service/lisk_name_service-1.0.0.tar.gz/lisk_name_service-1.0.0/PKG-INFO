# Lisk Name Service SDK (Python)

> A lightweight Python SDK to resolve `.lisk` names into wallet addresses via the Lisk Name Service API.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Secure resolution via API key
- 🧠 Simple `resolve(name)` method
- 📦 Supports tree-shaking and Python modules

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install lisk-name-service
```

## Usage

```
from lisk_name_service import LNSClient

client = LNSClient("your-api-key")

try:
    address = client.resolve("vitalik.lisk")
    print("Resolved address:", address)
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed:", str(e))
```

## API

client = LNSClient("your-api-key")

Create a new client instance.

    `apiKey` – your unique API key (provided after wallet connect).


`resolve(name: string): string`

Resolves a .lisk name to its associated Ethereum-compatible wallet address.

Returns:

    address: string – the resolved Ethereum-compatible wallet address.

    ValueError if the name is missing or not found

	RuntimeError for other network issues

## 🧪 Build (for contributors)

```
# from inside sdk/python/
pip install -e .
python3 -m tests.test_client
```

## 🔐 Notes

You must generate your API key by authenticating with your wallet on the LNS frontend.

Make sure your API key is kept secret and never exposed in frontend code.

You must pass a valid API key. To generate one:

Connect your wallet on the [LNS Dev Portal](https://https://lisk-name-server.vercel.app/dev-portal)

Sign a message

Copy your API key
