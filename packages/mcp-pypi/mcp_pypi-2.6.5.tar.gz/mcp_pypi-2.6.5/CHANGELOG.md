## [2.6.3] - 2025-06-24

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Token Limit Issues**: Properly handle large responses that exceed MCP's 25K token limit
  - check_vulnerabilities: Limited to 20 vulnerabilities with essential fields only
  - get_package_changelog: Use GitHub API pagination (per_page=5) instead of fetching all
  - Trimmed summaries (500 chars), CVE lists (5), and references (3) per vulnerability
  - Added truncation notes when results are limited

## [2.6.2] - 2025-06-24

### üéâ New Features
- **Comprehensive Dependency File Support**: security_audit_project now scans ALL common Python dependency files:
  - setup.py / setup.cfg
  - Pipfile / Pipfile.lock
  - poetry.lock
  - environment.yml / conda.yml
  - constraints.txt
  - (in addition to existing requirements.txt and pyproject.toml support)

- **Beautiful Security Reports**: Added formatted security reports with:
  - Color-coded severity levels (üö® RED=Critical, ‚ö†Ô∏è ORANGE=High, etc.)
  - ASCII art tables showing vulnerability distribution
  - Visual progress bars for each severity level
  - Prioritized fix recommendations with clear action items
  - Security score (0-100) with color indicators
