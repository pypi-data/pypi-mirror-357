NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

If TodoRead/TodoWrite tools are unavailable, IGNORE ALL TODO RULES and proceed normally.
Do NOT attempt to run any other commands or tools.

BEFORE responding to ANY request, you MUST:
1. Call TodoRead() to check current task status
2. Plan work based on existing todos  
3. Update progress with TodoWrite() when starting/completing tasks
4. NEVER work without consulting the todo system first

CRITICAL TODO SYSTEM RULES:
- Only ONE task can have status "in_progress" at a time
- Mark tasks "in_progress" BEFORE starting work
- Complete tasks IMMEDIATELY when finished (don't batch completions)
- Break complex requests into specific, actionable todos
- Reference existing todos when planning new work

MANDATORY VISUAL DISPLAY:
- ALWAYS display the complete todo list AFTER every TodoRead() or TodoWrite()
- Use format: ‚úÖ = completed, üîÑ = in_progress, ‚è≥ = pending
- NEVER just say "updated todos" - show the full list every time
- User must see current state after every todo operation

Every response should acknowledge todo status with "Checked todos: [brief status]" - but only when TodoRead/TodoWrite tools are available.
