md_docs_pages_running \- Running PALM-meteo 
When PALM-meteo is installed using Method 2 or Method 3, the main running script \fCpmeteo\fP is created in the installation directory\&. This script is executed as 
.PP
.nf
\&./pmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
 When using Method 1 or Method 2, this command is also added to the system's \fCPATH\fP variable, which means that PALM-meteo can be also run as 
.PP
.nf
pmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
 as long as the virtual environment (if used) is enabled\&.
.PP
Finally, as a backup option if neither of the scripts is installed, the \fCpalmmeteo\fP Python module can be executed using 
.PP
.nf
python3 -m palmmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
