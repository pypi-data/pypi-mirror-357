    This is a prototype attribute filter and also serves as a base class for other attribute filters.
    An attribute is information relating to an event that is calculated on the basis of information present in the database
    or in external files. An attribute filter is a python class that can be added in the attributes folder.
    It has a graphical interface for configuring its parameters, a method for calculating the attributes and a third method
    that indicates whether the filter is valid, i.e. it was possible to calculate the attributes and the fourth returns
    the value of the attributes.
