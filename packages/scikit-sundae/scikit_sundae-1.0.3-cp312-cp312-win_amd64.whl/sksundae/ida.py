    def __init__(self, resfn: Callable, **options) -> None:
        """
        This class wraps the implicit differential algebraic (IDA) solver from
        SUNDIALS. It can be used to solve both ordinary differential equations
        (ODEs) and differiential agebraic equations (DAEs).

        Parameters
        ----------
        resfn : Callable
            Residual function with signature ``f(t, y, yp, res[, userdata])``.
            If 'resfn' has return values, they are ignored. Instead of using
            returns, the solver interacts directly with the 'res' array memory.
            For more info see the notes.
        **options : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments to describe the solver options. A full list of
            names, types, descriptions, and defaults is given below.
        userdata : object or None, optional
            Additional data object to supply to all user-defined callables. If
            'resfn' takes in 5 arguments, including the optional 'userdata',
            then this option cannot be None (default). See notes for more info.
        calc_initcond : {'y0', 'yp0', None}, optional
            Specifies which initial condition, if any, to calculate prior to
            the first time step. The options 'y0' and 'yp0' will correct 'y0'
            or 'yp0' values at 't0', respectively. When not None (default),
            the 'calc_init_dt' value should be used to specify the direction
            of integration.
        calc_init_dt : float, optional
            Relative time step to take during the initial condition correction.
            Positive vs. negative values provide the direction of integration
            as forwards or backwards, respectively. The default is 0.01.
        algebraic_idx : array_like[int] or None, optional
            Specifies indices 'i' in the 'y[i]' state variable array that are
            purely algebraic. This option should always be provided for DAEs;
            otherwise, the solver can be unstable. The default is None.
        first_step : float, optional
            Specifies the initial step size. The default is 0, which uses an
            estimated value internally determined by SUNDIALS.
        min_step : float, optional
            Minimum allowable step size. The default is 0.
        max_step : float, optional
            Maximum allowable step size. Use 0 (default) for unbounded steps.
        rtol : float, optional
            Relative tolerance. For example, 1e-4 means errors are controlled
            to within 0.01%. It is recommended to not use values larger than
            1e-3 nor smaller than 1e-15. The default is 1e-5.
        atol : float or array_like[float], optional
            Absolute tolerance. Can be a scalar float to apply the same value
            for all state variables, or an array with a length matching 'y' to
            provide tolerances specific to each variable. The default is 1e-6.
        linsolver : {'dense', 'band'}, optional
            Choice of linear solver. When using 'band', don't forget to provide
            'lband' and 'uband' values. The default is 'dense'.
        lband : int or None, optional
            Lower Jacobian bandwidth. Given a DAE system ``0 = F(t, y, yp)``,
            the Jacobian is ``J = dF_i/dy_j + c_j*dF_i/dyp_j`` where 'c_j' is
            determined internally based on both step size and order. 'lband'
            should be set to the max distance between the main diagonal and the
            non-zero elements below the diagonal. This option cannot be None
            (default) if 'linsolver' is 'band'. Use zero if no values are below
            the main diagonal.
        uband : int or None, optional
            Upper Jacobian bandwidth. See 'lband' for the Jacobian description.
            'uband' should be set to the max distance between the main diagonal
            and the non-zero elements above the diagonal. This option cannot be
            None (default) if 'linsolver' is 'band'. Use zero if no elements
            are above the main diagonal.
        max_order : int, optional
            Specifies the maximum order for the linear multistep BDF method.
            The value must be in the range [1, 5]. The default is 5.
        max_num_steps : int, optional
            Specifies the maximum number of steps taken by the solver in each
            attempt to reach the next output time. The default is 500.
        max_nonlin_iters : int, optional
            Specifies the maximum number of nonlinear solver iterations in one
            step. The default is 4.
        max_conv_fails : int, optional
            Specifies the max number of nonlinear solver convergence failures
            in one step. The default is 10.
        constraints_idx : array_like[int] or None, optional
            Specifies indices 'i' in the 'y' state variable array for which
            inequality constraints should be applied. Constraints types must be
            specified in 'constraints_type', see below. The default is None.
        constraints_type : array_like[int] or None, optional
            If 'constraints_idx' is not None, then this option must include an
            array of equal length specifying the types of constraints to apply.
            Values should be in ``{-2, -1, 1, 2}`` which apply ``y[i] < 0``,
            ``y[i] <= 0``, ``y[i] >=0,`` and ``y[i] > 0``, respectively. The
            default is None.
        eventsfn : Callable or None, optional
            Events function with signature ``g(t, y, yp, events[, userdata])``.
            Return values from this function are ignored. Instead, the solver
            directly interacts with the 'events' array. Each 'events[i]' should
            be an expression that triggers an event when equal to zero. If None
            (default), no events are tracked. See the notes for more info.

            The 'num_events' option is required when 'eventsfn' is not None so
            memory can be allocated for the events array. The events function
            can also have the following attributes:

                terminal: list[bool, int], optional
                    A list with length 'num_events' that tells how the solver
                    how to respond to each event. If boolean, the solver will
                    terminate when True and will simply record the event when
                    False. If integer, termination occurs at the given number
                    of occurrences. The default is ``[True]*num_events``.
                direction: list[int], optional
                    A list with length 'num_events' that tells the solver which
                    event directions to track. Values must be in ``{-1, 0, 1}``.
                    Negative values will only trigger events when the slope is
                    negative (i.e., 'events[i]' went from positive to negative).
                    Alternatively, positive values track events with positive
                    slope. If zero, either direction triggers the event. When
                    not assigned, ``direction = [0]*num_events``.

            You can assign attributes like ``eventsfn.terminal = [True]`` to
            any function in Python, after it has been defined.
        num_events : int, optional
            Number of events to track. Must be greater than zero if 'eventsfn'
            is not None. The default is 0.
        jacfn : Callable or None, optional
            Jacobian function like ``J(t, y, yp, res, cj, JJ[, userdata])``.
            The function should fill the pre-allocated 2D matrix 'JJ' with the
            values defined by ``JJ[i,j] = dres_i/dy_j + cj*dres_i/dyp_j``. An
            internal finite difference method is applied when None (default).
            As with other user-defined callables, return values from 'jacfn'
            are ignored. See notes for more info.

        Notes
        -----
        Return values from 'resfn', 'eventsfn', and 'jacfn' are ignored by the
        solver. Instead the solver directly reads from pre-allocated memory.
        The 'res', 'events', and 'JJ' arrays from each user-defined callable
        should be filled within each respective function. When setting values
        across the entire array/matrix at once, don't forget to use ``[:]`` to
        fill the existing array rather than overwriting it. For example, using
        ``res[:] = F(t, y, yp)`` is correct whereas ``res = F(t, y, yp)`` is
        not. Using this method of pre-allocated memory helps pass data between
        Python and the SUNDIALS C functions. It also keeps the solver fast,
        especially for large problems.

        When 'resfn' (or 'eventsfn', or 'jacfn') require data outside of their
        normal arguments, you can supply 'userdata' as an option. When given,
        'userdata' must appear in the function signatures for ALL of 'resfn',
        'eventsfn' (when not None), and 'jacfn' (when not None), even if it is
        not used in all of these functions. Note that 'userdata' only takes up
        one argument position; however, 'userdata' can be any Python object.
        Therefore, to pass more than one extra argument you should pack all of
        the data into a single tuple, dict, dataclass, etc. and pass them all
        together as 'userdata'. The data can be unpacked as needed within a
        function.

        Examples
        --------
        The following example solves the Robertson problem, which is a classic
        test problem for programs that solve stiff ODEs. A full description of
        the problem is provided by `MATLAB <rob-ex_>`_. While initializing the
        solver, ``algebraic_idx=[2]`` specifies ``y[2]`` is purely algebraic,
        and ``calc_initcond='yp0'`` tells the solver to determine the values
        for 'yp0' at 'tspan[0]' before starting to integrate. That is why 'yp0'
        can be initialized as an array of zeros even though plugging in 'y0'
        to the residuals expressions actually gives ``yp0 = [-0.04, 0.04, 0]``.
        The initialization is checked against the correct answer after solving.

        step-by-step approach.

        Parameters
        ----------
        t0 : float
            Initial value of time.
        y0 : array_like[float], shape(m,)
            State variable values at 't0'. The length must match that of 'yp0'
            and the number of residual equations in 'resfn'.
        yp0 : array_like[float], shape(m,)
            Time derivatives for the 'y0' array, evaluated at 't0'. The length
            and indexing should be consistent with 'y0'.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`~sksundae.ida.IDAResult`
            Custom output class for IDA solutions. Includes pretty-printing
            consistent with scipy outputs. See the class definition for more
            information.

        ----------

        method : {'normal', 'onestep'}, optional
            Solve method for the current step. When 'normal' (default), output
            is returned at time 't'. If 'onestep', output is returned after one
            internal step toward 't'. Both methods stop at events, if given,
            regardless of how 'eventsfn.terminal' was set.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`~sksundae.ida.IDAResult`
            Custom output class for IDA solutions. Includes pretty-printing
            consistent with scipy outputs. See the class definition for more
            information.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            'method' value is invalid. Must be 'normal' or 'onestep'.
        ValueError
            'init_step' must be run prior to 'step'.

        Notes
        -----
        In general, when solving step by step, times should all be provided in
        either increasing or decreasing order. The solver can output results at
        times taken in the opposite direction of integration if the requested
        time is within the last internal step interval; however, values outside
        this interval will raise errors. Rather than trying to mix forward and
        reverse directions, choose each sequential time step carefully so you
        get all of the values you need.

        SUNDIALS provides a convenient graphic to help users understand how the
        step method and optional 'tstop' affect where the integrator stops. To
        read more, see their documentation `here`_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        message : str
            Human-readable description of the status value.
        success : bool
            True if the solver was successful (status >= 0). False otherwise.
        status : int
            Reason for the algorithm termination. Negative values correspond
            to errors, and non-negative values to different successful criteria.
        t : ndarray, shape(n,)
            Solution time(s). The dimension depends on the method. Stepwise
            solutions will only have 1 value whereas solutions across a full
            'tspan' will have many.
        y : ndarray, shape(n, m)
            State variable values at each solution time. Rows correspond to
            indices in 't' and columns match indexing from 'y0'.
        yp : ndarray, shape(n, m)
            State variable time derivate values at each solution time. Row
            and column indexing matches 'y'.
        i_events : ndarray, shape(k, num_events) or None
            Provides an array for each detected event 'k' specifying indices
            for which event(s) occurred. ``i_events[k,i] != 0`` if 'events[i]'
            occurred at 't_events[k]'. The sign of 'i_events' indicates the
            direction of zero-crossing:

                * -1 indicates 'events[i]' was decreasing
                * +1 indicates 'events[i]' was increasing

            Output for 'i_events' will be None when either 'eventsfn' was None
            or if no events occurred during the solve.
        t_events : ndarray, shape(k,) or None
            Times at which events occurred or None if 'eventsfn' was None or
            no events were triggered during the solve.
        y_events : ndarray, shape(k, m) or None
            State variable values at each 't_events' value or None. Rows and
            columns correspond to 't_events' and 'y0' indexing, respectively.
        yp_events : ndarray, shape(k, m) or None
            State variable time derivative values at each 't_events' value or
            None. Row and column indexing matches 'y_events'.
        nfev : int
            Number of times that 'resfn' was evaluated.
        njev : int
            Number of times the Jacobian was evaluated, 'jacfn' or internal
            finite difference method.

        Notes
        -----
        Terminal events are appended to the end of 't', 'y', and 'yp'. However,
        if an event was not terminal then it will only appear in '\\*_events'
